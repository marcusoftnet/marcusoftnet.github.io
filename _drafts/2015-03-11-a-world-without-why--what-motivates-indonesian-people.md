When I first arrived in Indonesia I didn't think nor knew much about the difference in our culture. This quite understandable, although in hindsight I should have read up on it a little bit more. Now, as I know more and more, I also get more and more interested and confused about some very basic things in the society. For this post I wanted to focus on "What are motivating Indonesian people?"

There's a lot of disclaimers to be made and I'll do that throughout the post, but here are few to get started:

1.	These are merely my observations after 15 months in the country. I've been working with quite a lot of people (met maybe 300+) and in a few different companies.
2.	It's very easy to jump to a conclusion that some behavior is stupid or wrong. I don't want to do that, so in everything I write here I will try to remember that it's just different cultures that have formed us under many many years into what we are. For example, consider some strange tradition that you've seen in another culture (dressing up like dragons and jumping around on poles for Chinese New Year for example). It shouldn't take you long to find a similar ridiculous event in your own culture (Santa anyone? Easter Bunny etc).

Oh, this post is mostly me reasoning. I have no ambition so solve any problems. Although, I think that this can be useful for you even if you never leave your own country (in which case I pity you - get out there!). Remember that each organization form subcultures of their own. Maybe this can help you understand things in another department.

Let's get started... I'm fearing it might be long.

# Group vs individual
First we need to realize one important fact. Indonesian (and many Asian cultures I presume) is a group culture. This stands in stark (yes, Swedish readers that [word can be used here](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/stark)) contrast to my own culture which is very individual based.

By no mean an expert I can still say that in a group culture the well-being of the group (company, people with same profession as me, village / neighborhood or what have you) comes before the well being of yourself. In fact "your group" could even be more important to you than other structures that the group is a part of; the society at large for example. I might be a little bit loose around how I follow laws if it give my group an advantage.

Just as some people from my own culture might consider a white lie, or not reporting the correct tax numbers because it gives ME an advantage.

Please don't mistake this group focus in the way I did. It's not "me and my group" - it's "the group". There is no me. That took me (no pun intended) ca 6 months to grasp.

A fun example of this happened in church the other day. I sat next to two women that was less accomplished in singing. In an individualist culture you'd keep your singing back then, right. Who'd wanted that to be heard? But these two (and everyone else) was singing loud and proud. Because the group was singing right - everyone chips in or it's not the group that singing.

I think that this difference is one of the biggest sources to many of my misunderstandings, because it runs deep into whatever we do.

# Fatalism
[Fatalism](https://www.google.com/search?q=fatalism&oq=fatalism) is
<blockquote>the belief that all events are predetermined and therefore inevitable</blockquote>

This belief can be seen in many cultures, but my guess (see how scientific I am here) is that the Muslim culture, ways and beliefs has influenced the Indonesian society around this. [Insha'Allah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insha%27Allah) is the well know saying stating that "It will happen if God are willing".

In normal daily life this means that Indonesian in general doesn't really think that they can affect their situation and context. "So I'm stuck in this crappy job - well I better work then". Whereas we Individualist would say; ["So I'm stuck in this crappy job - better fix that!"](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ChangingPerspectivesOnYourJobWillYouRenewYourBossForAnotherSeason.aspx) - Great article by the way.

# Here and now
One thing that have really frustrated and fascinated me during my time here is the seemingly little interest in the future. Or the past for that matter. Life here, for many, is just about here and now. In some cases this is because people are poor and life is just 

Related to this is the non-questioning attitude found in most environment I've seen here. You don't question authority - why should you? They k
