I've just completed my first ever big room planning meeting (an exercise made famous by [SAFe](http://scaledagileframework.com) in their [PI Planning](http://scaledagileframework.com/pi-planning/)). That was quite an excerises and I'm totally worn out. But also immensely impressed by the team and the amount of learning that took place in the room today. 

It was quite noisy at times but after 8 hours we went home with our sights aligned and a much better feel for what we will do the upcoming period (5 weeks in our case).

Still I could not get one thought out of my head. It stuck there a few days back and won't get unjammed: 

> This big room planning stuff is really an anti-pattern and should be eliminated

In this post I want to explain why and also tell you why I still think it was great.

## Investments

In order to prepare for the meeting we have held a lot of preparation meetings: 

* A few just to set up the preparing
* One introduction meeting with everyone involved
* One prioritisation meeting to get the backlog in order
* One meeting with product owners to clarify what is required from them during the meeting
* And a number of individual conversations

All in all most of these meetings has been good and useful, especially the prioritisation meeting that was needed to get the backlog in a good shape and prioritized so that we knew which items of the backlog, that was going to be addressed in the planning meeting.

We then held the meeting itself, involving about 25-30 people in our teams and ca 20-25 people from groups around us that we need to get our stuff out of the door. Some of these people were high-ranking people that (in case) we needed to resolve prioritisation issues and dependencies.

That's quite an investment to get our sights aligned and our work planned. 

We planned for 5 weeks ahead, which is much shorter than recommended by SAFe (8-12 weeks) but still enough that we didn't know for sure what is going to be delivered in the end of the session. 

## This is not needed…

As you might have seen on this [blog I'm re-reading the Toyota Kata book](http://www.marcusoft.net/2016/09/that-will-not-work-here-and-toyota-kata-mindset.html) and it refreshed my sight on what is different in the mindset of lean companies, such as Toyota; 

> They always seek to optimise and solve problems on the systemic level

Getting everyone together in a big room like this, investing in all those meetings, preparation work and effort during the day is just a workaround of a process that cannot handle fast flow of small items. 

The fact that we need to get everyone (45+ ppl) together in a room and put all other things aside for 8 hours straight to plan the upcoming 5 weeks in a batch is a testament to that our process and organisation, in it's current form, cannot support a faster flow.

This practice would not last long in companies that want to optimise flow - rather they would seek to find ways to do the planning just-in-time for smaller items at the time. Since that is in the vision of the production (in Toyotas case; 1x1 piece flow).

## But it can be could… for now

That said - I think that the exercise that we ran today was really good and helped us a lot. Many, many things were clarified during the day, some groups had their first ever common planning and it was the first time we got a business context for the things that we were about to start working with. All good things. 

But in the same breath I want to emphasise that we should try to find other, less intrusive, more flow-oriented ways of doing our planning - since flow is what we are after.

## What to do instead, mr wise-guy?

I can already now see how that easily could be accomplished with a kanban board for the high-level stories (we summarise those in a one page format) that are lined up for development. With a WIP limit on the number of stories in development and maybe another one for how many that can be ready this can easily be managed. For example with this kanban board:
