[Scope creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_creep) is a common phenomenon in software development where the size and workload increases beyond what we first envisioned. In many cases this is so small that it happens without anyone really noticing but sometimes it can degenerate and slow down progress considerably. Sometimes even stopping a progress or team completely. 

Scope creep comes from many sources, sometimes from the outside, but I think that the most common one are ourselves:

> That value should probably be a configuration property...
>
> What if someone decides to change database server...

This is of course good questions to ask and could be value, but I think there's more value in getting a feature in front of users and learn about their behavior and how the feature is doing. After that we can harden it, make it more flexible or otherwise improve it. 

This post is really about how I've seen scope creep being visualized and managed by a few teams on their board.
