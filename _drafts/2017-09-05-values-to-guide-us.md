I think I'm not a fan of best practices. For me best practices are limiting us to be only as good as the practice. Admittedly, that can be pretty good - but I'm looking to become better than I ever thought possible. 

Also, as I'm a guy that make my living trying to teach people (often) practices, I have to make another disclaimer; best practices can be inspirations for us to build upon. However I often see companies and teams instead focusing on implementing the practice. 

What I'm looking for is the principle that led to that practice. And even better; what are the values that pushed us to those principles. 

In this post I wanted to mention a couple of good examples of when values can move teams, organisations and complete communities forward to place that no one would had imagine or reached should we had followed some best practices.

## Aptitud

I work for a consultancy called [Aptitud](http://www.aptitud.se/). We are about 35 people right now and the reason I like work there is that we are founded on some simple values and we are sticking to them. 

The whole idea of Aptitud is founded on the value of trust and transparency. There's much to be said about what we have done around that but here's a few things that comes out of those values. 

* Utl√§gg
* Hiring
* Salary

What I wanted to talk about specifically in this post is what happens when you let the values guide you. We have had a little bit of a crisis in the company, as two of our founders decided to leave us for other adventures. 

Now this was a time for our values to shine. For different reason our values was not fully reflected in the ownership structure. We decided (together) to take the opportunity to do something about that. Now all employees are shareholders and associates in the company. We trust you from day 1. 

How important are these values for us, you ask:

* People have given up (diluted) their shareholder positions in the company to make sure that the entire company is represented
* Extensive work has been made with legal experts to find ways to structure the company as we want - about a year in the making.
* The shareholder in the original structure have all chipped in money to be able to structure the company as we wanted. 

But now we are in a position where the [ownership structure is supporting the way that we want to function](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/happens-now-anders-l%C3%B6wenborg). 

And it feels great to work for a place that stands up for the values it is founded on. This was what the values were for - to find ways of becoming better when we faced great challenges.

## Conclusion

Let the values transform us into something that is better than we thought possible, over letting our values stand back for the way the reality is around us.
