The other week I saw the most amazing transformation of a person I've seen in a few years. [The number one spot is taken by Ibu Elsye](http://www.marcusoft.net/2015/10/how-trust-kanban-and-a-little-structure-saved-a-life.html). 

As many of the other times I've seen changes like these I realize that the transformation, as well as the state before and after, are solely (not largely, but solely) created by the system we create for people. 

I'll elaborate on that as soon as I've described the change that I saw.

# At first ...

In my current team we needed to pave the way for easier deployments and to iterate and move faster. Since the company we work on doesn't really embrace these ideas (yet) all, we have created a little task force to automate our build and some of our infrastructure creation needs. 

In doing so we created a team with people from the different organizations needed to pull this off. One of those organizations was very old school. They are all resource utilization and maximizing the efficiency in the individual workers output. 

It was, in a word, shocking to witness. The people (in which we soon will see an amazing change) from that organization:

* Came into the room unprepared to our first meeting and the task in general - since he had been busy until the meeting started with other tickets
* Stated clearly that tickets is the way to get paid around here so we need to talk about how that will be handled during these weeks
* Looked gloomy and disillusioned during the initial days
* Repeatedly asked what he really was here to do
* Referred to problems being "not my area", "I only do X - I know nothing about Y" and "you'll have to ask [corporate function Z] about that "

Everything about them was siloed and slow. They even kept uptight around the coffee we had together.

# But then ...

# And that probably has to do with ...
