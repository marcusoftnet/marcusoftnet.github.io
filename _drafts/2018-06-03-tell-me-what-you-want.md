I have a very particular set of memories from my childhood, that revolvs around me falling, hitting or otherwise hurting myself. If it was just a bruise my father often said to me:

> Is it worth crying for, like that?

(I was probably exaggerating quite a lot). Of course it was!

> Tell me, what are you going to do if it really hurts, then?

That was maybe not pedagogically correct for a child in pain but it at least got me thinking. Indeed… what comes after screaming and crying? Could I turn this up? Would it make a difference? Would I get … yes what was it I wanted, really? Maybe just a hug or comfort. Could I get that by other means of communication that the display I was putting on now? 



Of course 7-year old Marcus didn't reflect on his behaviour this deeply. Hey, 44-year old Marcus barely does that. But at some clients that thought comes back to me from time to time. In the way deadlines are communicated. 

<a name='more'></a>

Have you ever had this said around something you are *developing*

> This **has** to be done, by Monday! 

You know you have. The important feature X. It just **has to** be done! 



Sentencenes like begs so many questions. Here are a few:

* Or else? What will happen (to us) if we don't get it done? What is the punishment?
  * Is this the kind of management that we want to have around here? Do this, or else!
* Can we do it in another way than was origninally intended, to reach the deadline? 
  * Can we, for example, skip some parts?
* If we can't skip parts - who knew that Monday was even reasonable? `Build this rocket-ship from chewing gum! I don't care how you do it, as long as it's done by Monday!`
* For who is this so important? What happens to that poor schmuck? (Does (s)he need a hug?) Can we help out some other way?
* This is horrible stress and I don't want it to happen again - are you willing to have a meeting, in retrospect - once all of this is over, to ensure that we do these things better the next time around? 

But alas, people ~~screaming~~ speaking that kind of sentences seldomly have the patience and time to listen to any of my questions and I'm left trying to do whatever I can to get it done. Often with stress, bad quality and bad feelings for the person and my job as a result. 



Brrr… horrible. Let's spins this a bit more positive, shall we. Because, in many instances that I've experienced **has to** really means **I want to**, so that the sentence, in nice-speak, becomes:

> I would like this to be completed by Monday, if possible. 

So now we have someone using the same trick as I tried to run on my father, as a 7-year old boy with scrapes on my knees. And you know what my father would have said:

> If you say '**has to**' when you really meant '**I want to**', then what are you going to do if it really **has to** get done by a certain date? 

Yeah, that's worth thinking about. What would that be? 

* `It is done!`
* `You have no idea how much this has to be done…`
* `DoneDone!` and `HasToHasTo`

Kids has tried to solved this problem:

* `hastohastohastohasto…`
* `has to, more than you can say`
* `has to, this time I mean it`

But that's just silly (although I've actually heard that last time spoken by grown-up managers a few times). 

Indeed silly. 



Thinking of this we soon realize that the poor person telling us that it **has to** be done, probably just want to express, with emphasis, that this is important. But just as I reflected… let's think about a better way to express this. One that, maybe, could take some of the drama out of it and be more objective and tangible. 

Luckily for us, way smarter people than me has already thought long and hard about this. My favorite is a very mellow and goodhearted (in person), but superclear and a bit short (his own words) in writing [Dr Donald Reinertsen](https://twitter.com/dreinertsen?lang=en). 

In his seminal book [Principles of Product Development Flow](https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Product-Development-Flow-Generation/dp/1935401009/) he defines the Cost of Delay function. There's pages on what it is but in it's core the idea is very simple;

> What does it cost, per day (or something), to not have this thing done now.

Here's how I explained it as a contrast to deadlines, a while back: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Experiment; when you get a task with a dead-line, ask how much each late day will cost. My hypothesis is that most deadlines are artificial</p>&mdash; Marcus Hammarberg (@marcusoftnet) <a href="https://twitter.com/marcusoftnet/status/789755541560188928?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2016</a></blockquote>

But you are much better of hearing what Dr Reinertsen says:

> And then I would ask: "How much more money would you make if you made product development faster?"
> ...

> The answer I kept getting from people was: I have no idea. 

Later on he define cost of delay, in it's basic level:

> If everything
