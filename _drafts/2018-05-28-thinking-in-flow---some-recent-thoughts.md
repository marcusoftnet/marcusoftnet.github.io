I talk a lot about flow these days and I'm continuously fascinated how many good things follows by shifting our focus to supporting a better, faster and smoother flow.

In this post I just wanted to share a few thoughts that has been on my mind lately.

### Focus on flow means focus on value, quite natural

<img src="/img/donkey-in-air-cart.jpg" width="100%" />

This picture above is my favorite picture on the net. I have done 2 hour lectures on lean with this as the only slide. 

I will not go in to all details, that can be observed and learned from this picture, but note how much value that get delivered. You can tell but I'm sure that poor animals legs are plenty busy, running for his life with fear. That business doesn't help much. None of the bags on the trolley gets delivered. 

At this point I often ask:

> What is the simplest and cheapest way to solve this problem? 

You'd be surprised how often people, seriously, suggest to buy a donkey more. That is easy, inhuman (inanminal?) and also expensive.  

The answer I look for is:

> Take some of those bags of. 

Of course. Simple. But that then begs the next question: 

> Which bags? 

Ah! That's not only harder but much more interesting. Because we want to take of the bags that doesn't provide value quickly, the ones that is far so that we can get the quick deliveries first. Or maybe the ones that is to odd addresses so that we can fulfill complete orders to the prioritized addresses first. Or maybe the most fragile ones should be delivered first so that we have handled the riskiest. Or maybe ...

The list could be long on what is the smartests thing to do - but note that all of these questions is about **improving the flow (business) value**. Not a single one of the (interesting) questions has to do with resource utilziation. 

What made that shift? Well that is easy to see by looking at the picture: 

> There's a maximum or even optimal capacity that the trolley can be loaded to. 

Quite simply; we (wellâ€¦ physics rather) put into place a work in process limit. That is the magical thing that started to ask all those questions about flow of value. Without that limit we would just push as much as possible onto the trolley. 

In fact, disregarding that limit is hard to imagine even, but maybe if we put stuff on loading bay without caring about the donkey (`That's the donkey's problem, I don't care`) could be one way to imagine that. 

### Focus on flow means focus on finishing things

In [Kanban In Action](http://bit.ly/theKanbanBook) we lead with one of my favorite sayings:

> Stop starting, start finishing

The meaning of this is that we should put our efforts into finishing things rather than to start things. For example; imagine that you finish some work - not you ~~should~~ could:

1. See if there's any work that you can finish
2. See if there's work that you can help someone else to finish
3. See if there's work that you could do to ensure a faster and smoother flow later (more on this below)

Bascially - whatever you can do to help finish work is preferred over starting new work. This has been summed up beauitfully by David P Joyce:

Seriously. I have said this to people and they thought I said somehting smart and profound. Deep nodding and sighs of `Yes. That *is* true.` as been uttered. 

We are here to take ideas to things that users can use. That what the [Agile principle means with working software](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html): 

> Working software is the primary measure of progress.

Working software - software doing work for people that needs it. 

We don't do more of that by starting more things. We, hopefully, get more working software by finishing stuff. 

### Focus on flow means focusing on the whole

> The problem is in User Acceptance Testing. **They** are so slow

If you hear stuff like this then you systems thinking sense should tingle so that every bone rattles. This is not systems thinking and optimizing for flow. Focusing on the difference between "us and them" is a slippery slope down to local optimizations. 

For example

- Why is UAT slow? 
- Don't pull things that you know will get stuck
