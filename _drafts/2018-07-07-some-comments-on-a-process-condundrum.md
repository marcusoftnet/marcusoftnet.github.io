One of the most rewarding parts of writing the [Kanban In Action](http://bit.ly/theKanbanBook) book is to hear stories and questions from people that have read the book, and been helped (or challenged!) by it. That is the real reward of any writing, including this blog, for me - hearing that I've influenced others. 

Sometimes I have the great pleasure of answering questions from my readers. When I get the opportunity I always try to share the answers here. 

Here's one question from Ashwati that I wanted to ponder together with you:

> I had a query which I thought I could consult with you in concern with the general process of a Software Product Development Organization.
>
> We seem to have Requirement Specification bottlenecks a lot. After a fix detailed specification analysis is done and the project enters development phase, we seem to be doing multiple iterations on the requirements.
>
> This, of course, comes from Clients / Change in Requirements from the Sales Team.
>
> Due to this, we have to constantly make edits and changes, not to mention introduce new fundamentals in the Technical Design phase.
>
> This seems to be a huge setback where deadlines are concerned and we are unable to plan a fixed release.
>
> Now, I have been of the opinion to isolate the requirement phase from the development phase but I am not sure whether that would be the right way to do it.
>
> Could you please throw some light on this?

Indeed - let's see if we can share some light. I have at least three thoughts I wanted to share.

## Disclaimer

I obviously don't know your paritular situation and hence are giving advice from my general, but deep, understanding of similar situations as well as the principles of agile, lean and kanban. 

## Flow when you can - pull when you must

Speaking of principles, the most powerful principle I know is the one underpinning not only lean but also most of agile - best summed up in one of the foundational principles of kanban:

> Help work to flow!

Meaning - promote a fast and smooth flow of work. Over keeping resources working and utilised. I've [written about this before here](http://www.marcusoft.net/2013/05/low-wip-hairdressers-and-lean-operation.html#flow-efficiency-versus-resource-utilization) and in latter years become more and more aware of that this is the most important shift in mindset that we need to take to make the best use of agile methods. 

That's fine and dandy but what does it mean in practice for your situation? 



## Don't waterscrumfall it

## Just in time - not just in case
