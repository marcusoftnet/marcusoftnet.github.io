I stumbled across a question the other day that started a thought in the back of my head that I couldn't out. Partly because I had two very different answers and partly because both of the answers left me feeling that I missed something important. 

The question was this:

> How can we be know the capacity across all our teams in the department?

In this post I wanted to write down my reasoning and see if I could get to some conclusion on how to answer this question.

<a name='more'></a>

## What was the question now again?



we want to know, across the tribe, how we are doing in project X. 

## What I want to say

What are you going to do with that information? Which decisions are you going to make differently based off this data? 
Are there other ways to get to that information? 
Examples 

## What I probably dare to say

Slice the stories similarly across the tribe. 

* Each epic is at most 5 stories. Each story has exactly one acceptance criteria. 
* have each team only accept things on their board that they think will take at most 5 days. 
* just track and use that data to make predictions about the future.
