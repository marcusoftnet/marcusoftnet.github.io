## My CV

You can read my [Linked In CV here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcusoftnet/), which is always kept up to date.

Or download a more [traditional proper CV from this link](CV-Marcus Hammarberg.pdf), that might need some updating from time to time

## Longer introduction

During the years I have been moving around quite a bit in different roles in the industry. I started my career as a developer but soon got to be leader for the teams I was in. This got me to look into finding ways to become more effective as a team.

I’m very quick to get excited over new things and this reflects in my posts that ranges over a lot of different subjects, tools and technologies.

The underlying theme of it all is [agile](http://www.agilemanifesto.org) lean and it’s practical usage in the situations I find myself in.

### Why this blog?

This blog started with me loosing three notebook (paper versions) in two weeks. I grew tired of trying to remember everthing I learned in my head and started to write it down instead.

During the years I learned so much by sharing and soon I picked up the theme for the blog: "sharing is learning". Just the other day I got some evidence that I might be on the right track too:

> We Learn . . .10% of what we read, 20% of what we hear, 30% of what we see, 50% of what we see and hear, 70% of what we discuss, 80% of what we experience, 95% of what we teach others
William Glassner

So ... it might be for my selfish learning purposes I write this. Anyway I'm very happpy to share this with you... to learn more ... to share more ... to learn more ... to

#### My family

I have one wife, Elin, and three boys; Albert (born 2008) and Arvid and Gustav (2010). We have lived in Indonesia for a few years, but home is Stockholm, Sweden.

#### Salvation Army and Indonesia

Yes, I lived in Indonesia for two years (2014-2015) working for the Salvation Army there. Me and Elin are worked with the 6 hospitals (and 17 clinics) that the Salvation Army have, trying to help them to become more effective in their medical and spiritual ministry. I wrote a [book about that experience](https://www.amazon.se/-/en/Marcus-Hammarberg/dp/1719485135)

#### Aptitud

Back home in Sweden I work for [Aptitud](http://www.aptitud.se) - the best consultancy in Sweden! I am an agile coach working right between the business and IT if I get to choose. My motto is: Getting agile to work, which makes me focus on pragmatic solutions rather than theory.

Although I’ve become a process guy I’m still interested in code and the craft around software development, in all the stages of the development cycle.

### Stuff I've done

#### Kanban In Action

By far the biggest thing I ever did was to write [Kanban In Action](http://bit.ly/theKanbanBook). I did that together with my good friend [Joakim](http://www.joakimsunden.com)

Writing the book took about 2,5 years. Sometimes with a lot of frustration and work above our capacity. The pride and relief we felt when it was released was worth almost all of that work.

The

If you haven’t got the book yet - get your’s today! We have done our very best to be both entertaining and informative.

#### Salvation: The Bungsu Story

The thing that I'm most proud of recently for work is my book about our adventures in Indonesia. It's a roller coaster of a novel about the work and tribulations of the Rumah Sakit Bungsu and how we used the principles of kanban, lean and agile to help them out of a looming disaster. Twice!

You can [get the book here](https://www.amazon.com/Salvation-hospital-Indonesia-reshape-company/dp/1719485135/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8). Please do - I'm really, really proud of it.

Or watch one of the many recorded talks of the story here:

#### Curriculum of School of Applied Technology

One of the most rewarding jobs I have had, here in Sweden, was when I worked as head of curriculum at [SALT](https://salt.dev), where we trained hundreds of wonderful people that now have software developer jobs in the industry. It's very rewarding to see how they are making a name for themselves.

I created the curriculum (together with Jakob Leczinsky) the first curriculum for SALT which took a totally new approach to teaching, through [mob programming](https://www.marcusoft.net/tags/#MobProgramming) and getting hands-on programming experience from day one and throughout the program.

The first bootcamp was about Full Stack JavaScript development and I then created two additional curriculums (.NET and Java) and a bunch of smaller courses in topics in and around being an effective software developer.

I led a team of instructors that successfully trained more than 700 developers during my time there.

#### Speaking

I like to do public speaking. During the years I have spoken at  lot of conferences like [OreDev](http://www.oredev.org), [JFokus](http://www.jfokus.se), [Agile Sweden](http://www.agilasverige.se), [Agile Singapore](http://2014.agilesingapore.org) and [Yow West](http://www.marcusoft.net/2015/05/yow-west----some-thoughts.html)

Most of my talks have been at or for clients of mine. You can catch some of them here:

* [On User stories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmmDMuZ0fcE)
* [On SpecFlow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j7RaGqVIyk)
* [On Specification by example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLdCV062lGs)
* [On Kanban (old version)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufCa1VlItLA) I’ve got a newer version of this talk but not recorded sadly.
* [On Kanban (longer old version)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLuSAuVIpI8)
* [On TDD for kids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ont8keNr08Y&list=UU3uq62oWJPm1agrW5Xxp_sA) I had great fun doing this!

I also did a [long series of short presentations](http://www.marcusoft.net/2015/06/new-series-marcus-on-business.html) for the Salvation Army in Indonesia:

Most slides for my talks can be found on my [Slide Share page](www.slideshare.net/marcusoftnet/)

#### Open source and programming

I have been into Open source on the .NET platform for quite some time. The main projects I've been into are:

* [NancyFx](http://www.nancyfx.org) Nancy is the super-duper-happy-path library to small and awesome web applications using .NET. I absolutely love this framework and have committed small things to this. Very proud to be on the [list of committers](http://nancyfx.org/contribs.html).
* [SpecFlow](http://www.specflow.org) SpecFlow is a great way to write specifications in english (using Cucumber) that then is translated to testing code of your choice. I’ve written a lot of blogposts about SpecFlow over the years and contributed the first version of the SpecFlow intellisense.
* [Simple.Data](https://github.com/markrendle/Simple.Data) I have commit code and written some [documentation](http://simplefx.org/simpledata/docs/pages/Test/Basics.htm) around this awesome data access framework.
* [Pickles](http://www.picklesdoc.com/#!index.md) lets you generate a nice documentation from your SpecFlow specifications

I’m most proud of my own little helper utility [SpecFlow.Assist.Dynamics](http://marcusoftnet.github.io/SpecFlow.Assist.Dynamic/) that let’s you write less code in your step definitions when using SpecFlow. You can download it from [NuGet](http://www.nuget.org/packages/SpecFlow.Assist.Dynamic/).

All of my code is found on [GitHub under marcusoftnet](https://github.com/marcusoftnet)

#### Screen casts

In 2014 I got interested in Javascript and Node development. This led me to do a couple of courses for [PluralSight](http://www.pluralsight.com/author/marcus-hammarberg) on Node development, of all things:

* [Introduction to Koa](http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/javascript-koa-introduction)
* [io.js and Node.js Next: Getting Started](http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/running-node-applications-io-js)
* [Introduction to npm as a Build Tool](http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/npm-build-tool-introduction)

I’ve also recorded a couple of screen casts around Koa on YouTube:

* [Installing Koa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fU7Vn30xcGw)
* [Explaining yield and generators](http://youtu.be/egLUa6urd6I?list=UU3uq62oWJPm1agrW5Xxp_sA)
* [Creating a simple CRUD HTTP API using Koa Js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTTjednotGQ&list=UU3uq62oWJPm1agrW5Xxp_sA)
