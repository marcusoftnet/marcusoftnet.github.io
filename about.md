## Normal short intro
Agile coach, Christian, .NET/NodeJs Developer, Euphonium player. Married to Elin and father to Albert, Gustav and Arvid. Lives in Indonesia for a couple of years. Author (with [Joakim Sunden](http://www.joakimsunden.com)) of [Kanban In Action](http://bit.ly/theKanbanBook)

## Longer introduction
During the years I have been moving around quite a bit. I started my career as a developer but soon got to be leader for the teams I was in. This got me to look into finding ways to become more effective as a team. 

I’m very quick to get excited over new things and this reflects in my posts that ranges over a lot of different subjects, tools and technologies. 

The underlying theme of it all is [agile](http://www.agilemanifesto.org) lean and it’s practical usage in the situations I find myself in.

## Stuff I've done

### Kanban In Action
By far the biggest thing I ever did was to write [Kanban In Action](http://bit.ly/theKanbanBook). I did that together with my good friend [Joakim](http://www.joakimsunden.com)  

Writing the book took about 2,5 years. Sometimes with a lot of frustration and work above our capacity. The pride and relief we felt when it was released was worth almost all of that work. 

If you haven’t got the book yet - get your’s today! We have done our very best to be both entertaining and informative. 

### Speaking
I like to do public speaking. During the years I have spoken at  lot of conferences like [OreDev](http://www.oredev.org), [JFokus](http://www.jfokus.se), [Agile Sweden](http://www.agilasverige.se) and [Agile Singapore](http://2014.agilesingapore.org). 

Most of my talks have been at or for clients of mine. You can catch some of them here: 
* [On User stories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmmDMuZ0fcE)
* [On SpecFlow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j7RaGqVIyk)
* [On Specification by example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLdCV062lGs)
* [On Kanban (old version)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufCa1VlItLA) I’ve got a newer version of this talk but not recorded sadly. 
* [On Kanban (longer old version)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLuSAuVIpI8)
* [On TDD for kids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ont8keNr08Y&list=UU3uq62oWJPm1agrW5Xxp_sA) I had great fun doing this!

Slides for my talks can be found on my [Slide Share page](www.slideshare.net/marcusoftnet/)

### Open source and programming
I have been into Open source on the .NET platform for quite some time. The main projects I’ve been into are:
* [NancyFx] (http://www.nancyfx.org) Nancy is the super-duper-happy-path library to small and awesome web applications using .NET. I absolutely love this framework and have committed small things to this. Very proud to be on the [list of committers](http://nancyfx.org/contribs.html). 
* [SpecFlow] (http://www.specflow.org) SpecFlow is a great way to write specifications in english (using Cucumber) that then is translated to testing code of your choice. I’ve written a lot of blogposts about SpecFlow over the years and contributed the first version of the SpecFlow intellisense.
