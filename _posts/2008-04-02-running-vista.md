OK - for the first time I am running Vista. I am really impressed so
far. Looks nice and work great - that's how we want to have it, isn't
it? That all Mac users probably goes bananas over all the
Mac-OS-rip-offs is nothing to care to much about.

Also this is my first posting using <a
href="http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!D85741BB5E0BE8AA!174.entry"
target="_blank">Windows Live Writer</a>, which is Microsoft's
blog-writer program. It also seems to work great.

Let's post and see

Oh yeah - it works ;)
