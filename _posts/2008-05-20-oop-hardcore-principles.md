Here
is a short list of good practices that caused quite a stir in the
designer community at [Avega](http://www.avega.se/).

<http://binstock.blogspot.com/2008/04/perfecting-oos-small-classes-and-short.html>

My thoughts on the subject are that these are some excellent quidelines
and a vision of a code quality that you might never reach. Also as the
blogger suggests, it might be a good way to force people to move away
from procedural coding - as for example when upgrading from VB6 to
VB.NET.

I have not followed all of these in my current project (it would lead to
a loo-ot of classes and assemblies) but having them nailed to the wall
has given my an opportunity to learn and use some of the guidelines. And
lo, and behold - my design was better and my code more readable.

He might be onto something here, the good Brikenstock...
