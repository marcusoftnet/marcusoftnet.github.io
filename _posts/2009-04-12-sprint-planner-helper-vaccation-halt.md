I am going to Ethiopia for two weeks and the project comes to a natural
(and needed) halt during that period.

I had hoped that I would have got further than this but I must stay
content with what I've got.

The visit to Ethopia will be something very different and exciting.
Especially with Albert who right now is 14 months and have just started
to walk...

Get back to you on the trip at
