[![VasaBand Christmas Concert 2006](/img/julkonsert06.jpg)

My band, the Vasa band of the Salvation Army, is really taking off right now.

We have had a year when we have lost a lot of bandsmen, so right now we're only about 17 in the band. However, the feeling and fellowship in the band have always been great. And during the last few months, we are also starting to play better and better.

In the spring, we will be reinforced with some more cornets—so (you know I like to look into the future) I predict that the spring will be great.

I just love to play in the band! It's so fun and we have a great time—thank you, guys!

If you are in Stockholm, you're more than welcome to our Christmas concert, 6 Dec, 1900.
