One of the things that really surprised me and my wife when we were
about to move to Indonesia was the schedule for our office. Every Friday
there's a scheduled 2,5 hour exercise pass from 8. Special exercise
clothing is provided by the office. Except once a month when we're
spending that time cleaning or repairing the office. These activities
are required and nothing else happens in the office at the time (no
meeting for example).

And everyone office (that I have seen and passed by on the streets) are
doing this. The bank down the road is exercising or playing soccer in
their parking lot. The police office is doing some aerobics in their
court yard and even the churches and the people working in them are
outside, exercising.

It felt a bit strange, but I can tell you that I have come to appreciate
these activities a lot, and maybe not for what you first would think.

This is my second post (find <a
href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2014/04/aligning-our-sights-what-indonesians.html"
target="_blank">the first post here</a>) on things in the Indonesian
culture that I have been happily surprised by and that I think is well
worth thinking about in a western culture too.

The thing that really caught my attention and the
fact that I liked this from the get-go was that we were doing this
**together**. Here's how a typical exercise pass would look like:


-   8-9 aerobics, the whole office. Everyone participates to their
    ability. We usually follow a video and someone in the office that is
    leading the exercise. I SUCK at this, of course. We have also taken
    walks or jogs around Bandung city.
-   9-10 some other sporting activity. Some of us play ping-pong or
    badminton. The soccer ball has been out and I even tried some
    <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsCWr1L0z7g"
    target="_blank">Takraw</a> (awesome sport by the way, but super hard
    to do. Harder than it looks even).
-   10-1030 snack and coffee together, before we hit the showers or just
    head for the office in our sweaty clothes. Yeah, it's a bit smelly
    but it's only 1,5 h to lunch.

It's a couple of hours full of laughter and easy going conversations.
Also you get to meet people from other parts of the office that you
might not normally interact with. Already after the first Friday
exercise pass I thought to myself:

> If I was a company owner/leader I would happily invest two hours each
> week where people get together and have fun. And exercise. And talk to
> each other to get to know each other better. 

The same goes for the cleaning days (every 4 week), but they have an
additional twist. On these days we take the exercise time to clean or
repair the office or the surrounding areas. These days are also filled
with laughter and conversation. The additional part is that we now are
cleaning the localities that we ourselves are using. We're making it
better/nicer/cleaner for us.

This last Friday the entire office spent the pass in the garden and the
exterior of the office. It was a joy to see people join forces and make
the surroundings beautiful and nice. In the Indonesian culture hierarchy
is important and strongly adhered to, but this was gone now. The highest
ranking manager (officer in Salvation Army speak) took instructions and
directions from the gardener. The gardener got input and ideas from the
finance staff etc. It was beautiful!

This makes me appreciate the things we have more, I think. It's unlikely
that I will spill something on the floor without cleaning up, since I
knew how hard it was to remove that coffee stain the last time. It also
create a much stronger feeling of this being **our** office I think. I
have invested more into it.

In the consensus culture that I come from you would probably have people
vote on what to fix next and do that together. Improving your world
little by little.

Connecting back to a <a
href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2013/05/lets-do-something-instead.html"
target="_blank">previous post</a> I think that doing stuff together,
especially physical things, bonds people. We, you and I, have planted
that tree. We have cleaned this together. I think it's a great way to
know the person behind the keys of all those emails, or that code or
what have you.
