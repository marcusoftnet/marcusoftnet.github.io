OK -
this is actually the first time i ever find something like this on the
net.

[Top 10 reasons VB.NET is better than
C#](http://www.vbrad.com/article.aspx?id=65)

This dude actually PREFER VB.NET over C#. He's in for a bashing from
about the whole level 4 (at least) at my customer...

Pretty lame list in my taste... There are at least 40 other things that
i miss in VB.NET that exists in C#. And to stop a top ten list a \#9
just confirms that this is squeezed out, just for the sake of it.

Well, well - he'll probably grow up and learn to talk a adult language.
Hopefully soon. Or he might stay on and play with <span
