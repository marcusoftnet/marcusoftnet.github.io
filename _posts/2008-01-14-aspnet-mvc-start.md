I am really hooked on a new thing from Microsoft called ASP.NET
MVC - which could be understood as "a project template for ASP.NET to
easily build applications with the ModelViewControl (MVC)-pattern"

I can now safely confess that i have actually never liked or fully
understood the ASP.NET programming model with Web Forms and User
Controls. It just to complicated to digest - a lot of events firing, on
some you can see the controls of the page and on other you don't. I
don't like it! At all!

But that is all in the passed from now (for me and a lot of other as it
seems), because now the ASP.NET MVC exists as a wonderful alternative.
There are already a CTP (preview) to
[download](http://asp.net/downloads/3.5-extensions/) and also some
really good introductions to the concept.

Here is my short-lists of must-reads and sees:

    MVC](http://www.nikhilk.net/Ajax-MVC.aspx)

Well, to summaries, i just love this way of looking at web applications.
It feels like: "Finally - i understand it!". I will never (or not
without some serious debating first) build in any other way, as i see it
now
