During the last three weeks or so I've been reading a great book,
[Head First Design
Patterns](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/hfdesignpat/). Now i have
finished it!

As [i said
earlier](http://www.marcusoft.net/2008/04/design-patterns.html); This is
the best, funniest and most informative IT-related book <span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">I've ever
read - and that is quite a few if you count my years at the
university.

I have tried to wrap my brain around Design Patterns many times but
failed, often due to the very academical language that is used
when you speak about such abstract thing. I cannot <span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_3" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">count the
number of times i got an "aaah", "so it was this simple?" or
"finally!"-feeling while reading this book.

Thank you!

Now if the [Head First team](http://www.headfirstlabs.com/) only could
put out some .NET stuff and I'll be <span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_6" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">buying lots
and lots of those.
