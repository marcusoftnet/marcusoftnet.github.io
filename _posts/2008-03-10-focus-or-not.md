OK - this last two weeks has been intense. I've started a new project at
my customer and it is wild; i am Scrum master (nothing new there;) it's

(Service Oriented Architecture) at my customer (a big Swedish insurance
company).

I am very humbled by the magnitude of the project and where this can

during the week.
