I've just come back from a vaccation in Bali. Due to some fortunate overbookings we ended up in a villa that a oasis of tranquility and luxury. By far the nicest place I've ever seen, including the room I stayed in for [Agile Singapore](http://2014.agilesingapore.org/). The 3 day stay flew by but was a blessing for my soul.

The villa was in an area of other villas in the same class together with some upper class hotel. All of them was boasting their luxury, their services and their capacity. Some had stars on them (I don't really know what those mean though).

I sat in our car on the way to the beach and we passed one hotel that looked small but very nice indeed. On the wall nothing was said about their services, no stars or anything like that. Just a simple, but [big](http://www.marcusoft.net/2014/09/ifyoubuildit.html), sign that said:
<blockquote>Inspections welcome!</blockquote>

I like this approach very much. It's open and friendly but at the same time states a quality awareness and pride about our work.

It reminds me of one of the many points made in the excellent [Turn the Ship around](http://www.amazon.com/Turn-Ship-Around-Turning-Followers/dp/1591846404#) book, by [David Marqueet](https://twitter.com/ldavidmarquet), namely "Embrace the inspectors". In the book they changed their mindset about the people to do the inspections from dreading (and maybe even dispising them) to instead starting to ask them questions to learn from them and their expecerices from inspecting other submarines. In short: they turned the "brrr inspection on Monday"-feeling to "Yah! Monday is learning new stuff"-feeling.

We have seen this a lot in the agile community of late, early releases, A/B testing to act on feedback given ([but do we really act on it](http://codebetter.com/marcushammarberg/2014/01/27/do-we-dare-to-be-data-driven/)?) so this is not news.

In my recent work I've been in another business (Hospitals) and here inspections are first of all very very important (could put you out of business). From that follows that _we_ dread the inspections and try to avoid them as long as possible. Which of course creates more work in preparing them.

In one instance, once the inspection was over, the entire hospital took a big breath of relief. So much tension gone. My first reaction was: "Let's do it again tomorrow".

Or at least: what if they could come back any time and do another inspection? Like tomorrow? Or the day after that? How would we change our behaviour?

Because the quality and attention given during the inspection was sensenational. Really really good. Some of it has stayed but not all of it. So the improvement was more like a spike than a gradual improvement over time.

But if the inspectors came back without us knowing... we would have to be better all the time.

Also - what do we do with the feedback we got from the inspection? Are we "Phew - that's OVER! Thank God!" or do we immeditately start acting on the things that we had to improve - longing to do better.

This is not costly. It's all in our mind. It doesn't take much but can the long lasting effects can change our company culture to the better, forever.

Do I dread the inspectors?
Do I have "Inspection welcome"-sign on my work, services and behaviour?
If I did - how would that change me, and the way people see me?
