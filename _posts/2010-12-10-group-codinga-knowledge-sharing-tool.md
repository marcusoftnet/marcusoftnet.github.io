I have the good fortune to from time to time give courses in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development"
target="_blank">TDD</a>. I organize these events in two parts; one
theoretical background part and then a practical part. During the
practical part I found great use of
<a href="http://codekata.pragprog.com" target="_blank">Code Katas</a> in
general and the Bowling Ball Kata in specific.

I really like the way that a kata helps you to focus on the thing you
trying to learn and in the case of the bowling ball take you through the
principles step-by-step.

However, lately I’ve also sheen that the very practice of gathering your
team in a room and go through a coding exercise on a screen together,
taking turns at the keyboard, has yet another great benefit. You start
to talk about your code.

In this case you can together create a shared understanding, shared
principles and code standard and finally build the team in a great way.

Yesterday we did this in my current team, and not before long we started
to get into discussions about the coding standards, the conventions
we’re using and how to design the system.

Also it’s a great learning experience on a low level; keyboard
shortcuts, new ways of doing stuff, Resharper commands etc. I’ve never
been in a this kind of session without learning a lots.

So I will sure take time to do this. We’re aiming on two hours each week
in my current team.

-   Code your way through a user story or a test, or a walking skeleton.
-   Do it together to get shared understanding and spread the principles
    and ways of your team.
-   Do it often to keep your standards up to date
