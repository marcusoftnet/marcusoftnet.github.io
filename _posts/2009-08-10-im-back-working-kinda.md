Sooo -
the parental leave is now over. I have spent six months "not-working"
and together with my son, Albert. It has been great but when looking
back it seem like the time has passed very fast.

OK - so now I am offically back in business. Well, by the way, let's see
if there is anything for me to do first. Otherwise I'll be "free" for a
little while longer. We'll see.

What I have done so far is just updated my CV. That's always rewarding
since it seems like you have done a lot of important work...

And now I have put way to much time into installing [Windows
7](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/). I have had a real hard
time to do it from a USB-stick. But here is a [great a
description](http://kmwoley.com/blog/?p=345) on how to install Windows 7
from USB-stick.

From that I'll try to [install Visual Studio
2010](http://blogs.combitech.se/salmi/archive/2009/05/18/visual-studio-2010-beta-slaumlppt.aspx)
and learn some more about it. The [new build
defintion](http://blogs.conchango.com/gracemollison/archive/2009/07/28/tfs-a-tale-of-two-versions.aspx)
and [working with
it](http://geekswithblogs.net/jakob/archive/2009/05/27/working-with-build-definitions-in-tfs-team-build-2010.aspx)
looks... interesting. I am sure about it yet... I'll get back to you on
that.
