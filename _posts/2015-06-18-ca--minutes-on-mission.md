Where I currently work there's been a problem with budgets for traveling. And another with authority. Which basically mean that the people that I'm here to try to help will not get my help; there's no money to travel there and I have no authority, which is basically a deal-breaker in Indonesia. 

What to do? Well, since [I grow bored very fast without anything to do](http://www.marcusoft.net/2015/01/i-run-on-feedback.html) I tried to find a way. 

I started a series of presentations about the topic I wanted to talk with "my clients" about, recorded them and uploaded to YouTube. I even made [extra effort to do great subtitles](http://www.marcusoft.net/2015/06/how-to-add-and-translate-captions-for-your-youtube-video-in--minutes.html), in two languages, just to increase the chance that they will understand me.  

Before anyone tells me; yes - I know that this is maybe the worst possible way of making sure that you get an important message across to someone that needs it. But it's what I can do now.

I will do a little series of posts here, where I share these presentations with you. I hope you find them interesting and entertaining. That was my goal anyway. 

Here's all the post in the series:

* [ca 10 minutes on Mission statements](/2015/06/ca--minutes-on-mission.html) (this post)
* [ca 10 minutes on Vision statements](/2015/06/ca--minutes-on-vision-statements.html)
* ca 15 minutes on Strategic plans
* ca 15 minutes on Impact mapping
* ca 15 minutes on kanban
* ca 15 minutes on root cause analysis
* ca 10 minutes on effective meetings

My main task here in Indonesia is to help our hospital to work out good strategic plans. It's a very interesting task since long-term strategies seems to not be very prominent in the Indonesia culture. 

There's also a translation issue about the word itself, Misi (mission), apparently have a different meaning for Indonesians that I use it. In this presentation I clarify how I use the word: as the reason for an organization to exists - our purpose. 

In the presentation I go through a couple of examples and take a look at the good and bad parts of them. 

There's also a short segment about values, which [I have blogged about before](http://www.marcusoft.net/2014/09/values.html).

You can see the presentation here, with EXCELLENT subtitles :):
