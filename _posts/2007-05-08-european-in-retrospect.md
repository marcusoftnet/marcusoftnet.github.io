So my
tip failed <span>="blsp-spelling-corrected">miserably</span> but i was tipping with
my heart. From [this
link](http://www.4barsrest.com/news/detail.asp?id=5566) you can find the
full result and see the <span>="blsp-spelling-error">Willebroek</span> won. Again - the second
year running.

From the live result service of 4<span>="blsp-spelling-error">BarsRest</span> i understood that the
playing from all the bands was exceptional. I've also spoken to some
bandsmen in the <span>="blsp-spelling-error">Gothenburg</span> band and know that they
was very pleased with their playing. How the <span>="blsp-spelling-error">judes</span> missed that i don't know - but
you never do.

I still think <span>="blsp-spelling-error">GBB</span> made and excellent job and really
went out with a bang. This is the last we will ever hear from <span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_6" class="blsp-spelling-error">GBB</span>. What a way
to end an era of high level brass band playing - a tour (playing with
Black Dyke) a CD recording (<span>="blsp-spelling-corrected">I'm</span> looking forward to it) and
then the Europeans.
