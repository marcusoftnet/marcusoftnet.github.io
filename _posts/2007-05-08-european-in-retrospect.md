So my
tip failed miserably but i was tipping with
my heart. From [this
link](http://www.4barsrest.com/news/detail.asp?id=5566) you can find the
full result and see the Willebroek won. Again - the second
year running.

From the live result service of 4BarsRest i understood that the
playing from all the bands was exceptional. I've also spoken to some
bandsmen in the Gothenburg band and know that they
was very pleased with their playing. How the judges missed that i don't know - but
you never do.

I still think GBB made and excellent job and really
went out with a bang. This is the last we will ever hear from <span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_6" class="blsp-spelling-error">GBB. What a way
to end an era of high level brass band playing - a tour (playing with
Black Dyke) a CD recording (I'm looking forward to it) and
then the Europeans.
