I've just entered a period of my project at work that is learning me why
SCRUM "iterations" are called sprints. After we have sprinted for seven
sprints in a row, with only a weekend in between each we have not
started a period of bug-cleaning.

And it feels so slow (this is the second week, mind you). Nothing that
pushes you, no goal in sight and just bugs coming in and being fixed.
Booooring!

But hey - if you're not bored the fun will not
feel as fun. I guess.

OK - in my private life there is loads of things to do right now so i
might be a blessing in disguise. I also try to do some reading up on new
technolgies - first in line is
[WCF](http://www.google.se/search?hl=sv&q=wcf+introduction&meta=) and
[LINQ](http://www.google.se/search?hl=sv&q=linq+introduction&meta=)
