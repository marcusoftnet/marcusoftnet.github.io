Since I took a way too long nap together with Abbe earlier this evening, I am now paying the price and can't sleep. This happens about once every fifth year or so, so why not take the opportunity to do something useful.

So now that I've done that (a PowerPoint presentation for work that never seems to top my priority and sending emails surrounding Christmas(!) concerts), I thought I'd upload some new pictures of Abbe.

Good night reader... [wherever you are](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_Caller#Quotes).
