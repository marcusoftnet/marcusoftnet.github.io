When a year has passed I often try to think back and find the one most important thing I learned. This year that was a bit tricky since I've learned so amazingly much. So good - and some bad.

The single piece of advice I got that stood out was about presenting. And it came from one of my oldest friends, one that I call my brother: [Kalle](http://twitter.com/kalleljungholm).

Kalle is a pretty young guy but he's very thoughtful and ... yes I'll say it: wise.

Another thing that stands out with him is the fact that he's just become a Salvation Army Officer, a pastor if you want.

The advice I got from him was just before I was about to deliver my first ever "message", or short sermon. I had asked him for all kinds of things about this but the final thing he left me with was:
<blockquote>The most important thing is to pray that you will become small so that the message (from God) will be bigger / clearer</blockquote>

or in other words:
<blockquote>You are not the most important thing!</blockquote>

BAM! It hit me like lightning; this is of course true for every presentation you ever give. You are not the most important thing - the message and how your audience receives / understands it is.

For some time I have focused more on how _I_ will present, how _I_ will look or come out. Not on the message.

This simple little sentence made me restructure my presentations but mostly gave me a new approach to my material. Even old material was improved just by approaching with another goal.

Thank you Kalle!
