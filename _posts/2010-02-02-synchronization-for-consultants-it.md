I am so proud. My <a
href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2009/09/synchronization-for-consultants-how-i.html"
target="_blank">evil scheme to keep my calendar(s)</a> in sync got
tested for real today.

Got to new customer. Installed [Outlook to Google
Calendar](http://www.google.com/support/mobile/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=138636).
Started Outlook. Viola! All my events from my other calendars in place
with the ones from my customer. So now they will not book me on days
when I have other assignments etc.

The only thing is that you cannot think to much about it because it will
drive you mad. My customer Outlook is synched with Gmail, my
<a href="http://www.avegagroup.se" target="_blank">Avega</a> outlook is
also synched with the same account to Gmail. My phone synchs to Gmail…
But it works. ‘Nuff said.
