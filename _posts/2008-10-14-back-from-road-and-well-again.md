The last week marked a significant step in this year for the [Vasa
Band](http://www.vasaband.se/). We released our brand new CD Priority
(as I wrote about
[here](https://www.marcusoft.net/2008/10/i-still-alive.html)) and also
embarked on a small tour of the western part of Sweden.

The tour was great - and the greatest part about it was the way we felt
that our message was received and understood. It's always good to be on
a tour, especially with this band, but this was something else; we had
really worked hard on getting the message about Jesus across and crystal
clear and it seems as it worked.

I am right now editing some of the recorded music and it doesn't sound
to bad either. Hopefully some of it will be posted on the [Vasa
Band](http://www.vasaband.se/) homepage in a while.

Oh yeah - I became sick on the last day, and the journey home was a
pain. I got sick to my stomach and most of all needed a toilet (where I
subsequently spent most of the night ;)) and not to sit in a minivan
trying to ... keep it in. Painful! I am better now though.

Thank you band for a great weekend. I love you guys!
