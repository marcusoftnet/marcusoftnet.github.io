The next
project will be done with Test Driven Development - I am really looking
forward to this!

We have all read about TDD, on this pros and cons and how it is done
(red, green, refactor or first write the test, fail it, fix it...). But
i haven't seen to much on how to actual write the code. How do you start
off? In other words - show me the code!

But [this article](http://www.codeproject.com/dotnet/tdd_in_dotnet.asp)
has some hints and tips on how to write test driven code for business
and ui-layers. Especially from the [Doing Test-Driven
Development](http://www.codeproject.com/dotnet/#h11) paragraph. The rest
of the article is a very nice introduction to Nunit and other tools.

I'll get back to you all when I have got the pieces together surrounding
this.
