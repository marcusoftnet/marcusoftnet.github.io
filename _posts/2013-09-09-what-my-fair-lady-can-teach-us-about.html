<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I have a confession to make: I'm a sucker for musicals. Especially those old ones with those jolly tunes. One of my all-time favorites is: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058385/">My fair lady</a>. Since I like these old musicals it happens from time to time that I find myself singing the tunes. Out loud. The other day it happened again, but this time it was actually appropriate. In fact; the song I was humming told me something about visualization.<br /><br /><br /><a name='more'></a>Here's the scene: Eliza Dolittle have is fed being taught how to speak properly. And leaves the professor that tries to teach her. She leaves the house only to find a young man (Freddy) that loves her madly. He tries to tell her so. In oh so many long, beautiful and complicated words. So Eliza sings the following song:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><object class="BLOGGER-youtube-video" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data-thumbnail-src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/H8zyF0ZOy3k/0.jpg" height="266" width="320"><param name="movie" value="http://youtube.googleapis.com/v/H8zyF0ZOy3k&source=uds" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><embed width="320" height="266"  src="http://youtube.googleapis.com/v/H8zyF0ZOy3k&source=uds" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div><br />The lyrics is brutal and to the point:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Words! Words! Words! I’m so sick of words!<br />I get words all day through;<br />...<br />If you’re in love, Show me!<br />Tell me no dreams filled with desire.<br />If you’re on fire, Show me!<br />...<br />Haven’t your lips longed for my touch?<br />Don’t say how much, Show me! Show me!</blockquote><h3 style="text-align: left;">Don't you usually write about IT?&nbsp;</h3><div>Well let's get this back on track... What does this have to do with us? What did this song tell me?&nbsp;</div><br />That often reporting and reports isn't enough. Even diagrams might fall short. If "we're on fire" about something that we have done - then show it! And do show a diagram, don't tell them "dreams filled with desire" - show something that works.<br /><br />And make sure that they understand. Put some effort into explaining it on the level so that they understand it. If it's important to you - then make sure that they actually get the message, actually understand. <br /><br />Transparency is great but if you don't care about that your message gets across it's pretty pointless. A visual board with a lot of tasks that no-one understands (for example too technical or too brief description) will soon just be an annoyance, just as reporting was before that.<br /><br />If you want others to understand and care about your work and your progress - then show them!<br />If you want to build trust with others around you - then show them your progress (good and bad) in a way that they understand.<br /><br />If you're on fire - show me!</div>
