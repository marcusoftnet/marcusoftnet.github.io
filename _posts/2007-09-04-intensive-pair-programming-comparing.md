For about four days straight now we have been battling a
classical, but hard programming problem; given two entity objects return
a list of all the differences between the objects data. We solved the
problem with reflection and some hard thinking. I am thinking about
posting an article on how later.

It has been quite fun but the real lesson for me was pair programming!
Try it if you haven't. It is intense, I can say - but also very
productive. Not as many errors and the code gets an immediate
review that is priceless. While the "driver" writes the co-pilot have a
chance to reflect on was is going on.

Also - it is lots of fun!
