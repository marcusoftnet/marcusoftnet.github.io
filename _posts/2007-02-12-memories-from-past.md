<div>

Got to listen in to a band that i loved as a teenager yesterday.
[Poison](http://www.poisonweb.com/thepoisonwebhtml/poison_web_all.html),
which believe it or not was a hard rock band in the 80's

Here we have it all; long poodle hair, harmonically singing (several
parts), the obligatorily guitar solo in each song and some really cheesy
lyrics.

Listen to them and let it take you back. Way back.
