The European is now to an end and some shocking results was delivered.... Here is the [complete results](http://www.4barsrest.com/news/detail.asp?id=7753), where you can note that the Oberoesterreich Brass Band were placed 10/11 which is really strange since they got some raving reviews.

For our [Swedish contender](http://www.stockholmbrass.se/) things didn't work out to well. I think that the approach to a competition is shown very clear with the results. For band - with a lot of amateurs, like [Stavanger](http://www.stavanger-brassband.no/english/index.htm), [Cory](http://www.buyasyouviewcoryband.co.uk/) or [Willebroek](http://www.brassbandwillebroek.be/) - it's life and death stuff. For bands with mostly pros things aren't as serious. And then you don't win any competitions against the other group. A 9 place for Stockholm Brass Band may have been a correct adjudication.

And for me things went quite well. [My predictions](https://www.marcusoft.net/2008/04/2008-european-championships-my.html) had the right three top bands, but not in the right order. I am not a big fan of [Cory](http://www.buyasyouviewcoryband.co.uk/) but apparently they kicked some serious butt in both events. Well done and well deserved then.

I always hope for the Norwegians to do well since I have a lot of friends there. Not this time (either?) for [Stavanger](http://www.stavanger-brassband.no/english/index.htm). Well, there is always next year.
