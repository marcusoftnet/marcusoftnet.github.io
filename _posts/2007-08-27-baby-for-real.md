As I've [hinted in earlier
post](http://marcushammarberg.blogspot.com/2007/08/home-again.html) we
are going to have a baby! In January 2008.

Up to now a lot of things has been questions and guessing about how
many, kind and most important health. But on Friday we went to an
ultra-sonic scan and got to know a lot:

- There is one - there are a lot of twins in the family but that is up
  to another family member to handle as it seems
- It is a healthy person - and no we haven't found out sex on it yet
- It was a quite astonishing experience - I couldn't imagine that they
  move around that much. We saw leg movements, hand waves and even a
  full turn. I have though about gymnast but can't figure out who of
  Elin and me that came from.

So now we know that we can stay in our apartment for a while and that
everything is alright so far. A great relief.
