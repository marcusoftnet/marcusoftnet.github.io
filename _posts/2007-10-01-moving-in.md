This weekend we had a moving in party. Yes, i know it's about half a
year late - but hey...

We just got two room repainted and fixed. It looks very nice and is
really a big difference from before. I have had my doubt if it was worth
it (living in one room with all the furniture's for two weeks is hard on
my orderly psyche) - but it sure is.

So the party saw some 20 people in our 68 m<sup>2</sup> apartment.
Crowded, crowded - but very nice and a lot new and old faces. Great to
meet everyone at once.
