I have been singing <a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2010/03/soapui-and-testing-wcf-services-how-i.html" target="_blank">SOAPUi’s praises</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2010/03/soapui-and-msbuild.html" target="_blank">lately</a> and it’s really great for testing services. In <a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2010/03/soapui-and-testing-wcf-services-how-i.html" target="_blank">this post</a> I describe how I made the whole thing work for testing WCF Services. <br />But, as stated in <a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2010/03/soapui-and-msbuild.html" target="_blank">this post</a>, there was still one more thing to be solved… The <a href="http://www.soapui.org/userguide/commandline/testcaserunner.html" target="_blank">endpoints from the command line</a>. You want to use different endpoints in different environments. And in my specific customer case I want one of them to stay the same all of the time, since that endpoint points (sorry, could not resist myself) to a “singleton” kind of service. <br />Luckily the SOAPUi team also have some great support (Thanks Ole, who replied in Swedish!). So here you have it – how to change the endpoint for one of your services under test from the command line – <a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2010/03/soapui-and-msbuild.html" target="_blank">which in my case means the build script</a>.<br /><ol><li>I first created a sample WCF service project (very vanilla, i didn’t touch the code just the default generated code).      <br />By the way; really cool hosting and test client stuff in Visual Studio 2010</li><li>I changed the binding to basicHttpBinding since that’s the only thing that work with SOAPUi. I used the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms732009.aspx" target="_blank">WCF Service Configuration tool</a> in Visual Studio of course. </li><li>I then created a normal SOAPUi project and let SOAPUi create testcases for me. I added asserts just to make sure that the I didn’t get an error back. </li><li>I started my service and ran the testcases – It worked! </li><li>I then, and here is the trick, created a project-wide property (Click project file and chose Custom properties in the lower part of the project window) to hold the endpoint value.      <br /><ol><li>I named the project wide property DemoServiceEndpoint </li><li>I gave it the address of the service I was testing as value </li></ol></li><li>I then opened the tree down to the test request in question and then chose the Test Property-tab in the lower part of the project tree </li><li>Here I entered this expression that reads the value from my project wide property:      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ${#Project#DemoServiceEndpoint} </li><li>I repeated for my other test request and tested. It still worked! </li><li>OK – we’re closing in now. Now I used the <a href="http://www.soapui.org/userguide/commandline/testcaserunner.html" target="_blank">Test Runner</a> to create my command (nifty stuff SOAPUi dudes!). Here I got the opportunity to set my parameter ${#Project#DemoServiceEndpoint}. </li><li>After some tweaking I managed to “harvest” the command into a .bat-file.      <br /><br /><pre>"C:\Program Files (x86)\eviware\soapUI-3.5\bin\testrunner.bat" -sDemoTestSuite -PDemoServiceEndpoint=<a href="http://localhost:8732/Design_Time_Addresses/Marcusoft.SOAPUiDemo.WCFService/Service1/">http://localhost:8732/Design_Time_Addresses/Marcusoft.SOAPUiDemo.WCFService/Service1/</a> C:\Dev\Marcusoft.SOAPUiDemo\EndPointOverrideDemo-soapui-project.xml </pre><br /></li><li>And it worked! </li></ol>So now I can change the endpoint from the command line! In my build script when I have deployed the service to the testing environment for example! Yeah!<br /><br />You can download <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2408484/Marcusoft.SOAPUiDemo.zip" target="_blank">my example here</a>.
