During the last week I took a course in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban" target="_blank">Kanban</a>
(<a href="http://crisp.se/kanbanjedi" target="_blank">Jedi level</a>
mind you well) a
<a href="http://www.crisp.se/" target="_blank">Crisp</a> in Stockholm.
Giving the course was
<a href="http://www.agilemanagement.net/" target="_blank">David
Andersson</a>, more or less the father of Kanban for software business
as I understand.

If you don’t know anything about Kanban (as I didn’t) then
<a href="http://www.crisp.se/henrik.kniberg/Kanban-vs-Scrum.pdf"
target="_blank">this article by Henrik Kniberg</a> is a great
introduction. Also keep your eyes open on
<a href="http://www.infoq.com/" target="_blank">Info-Q</a> for a
complete book on the subject with some great case studies.

I think that the course was really good and gave me some deeper
understanding in Lean-thinking. There are some simple but powerful tools
in there; visualization (put it up on the wall!), give room for the
value-adding things in your process and minimize waste,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_cause_analysis"
target="_blank">root-cause analysis</a> etc.

Kanban itself is not really that hard to grasp (thank God!) but it’s
like any game; the rules are simple but mastering it takes a lifetime.

I also felt a need to pick up the
<a href="http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_production"
target="_blank">Lean</a> thinking that is underlying the thoughts of
both Scrum and Kanban.

Also I am not that worried if it’s called Scrum, Kanban, XP or Lean
anymore. It’s just more tools in my agile toolbox. I’ll use them when
needed. The trick is to know when…. That is <a

target="_blank">being smart</a>.

I am sure that I will get back to Kanban several times in here.
