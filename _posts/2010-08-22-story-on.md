The last month I’ve read <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Goal-Process-Ongoing-Improvement/dp/0884270610"
target="_blank">The Goal</a> by
<a href="http://www.goldratt.com/" target="_blank">Eliyahu M.
Goldratt</a>. Apart from being a great book it was also written in a
really interesting way. It’s a novel in which we follow mr Alex Rogo and
how he learns the subject of the book
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_Constraints"
target="_blank">Theory of Constraints</a>. I thought that I might try to
mimic that style a bit in this post.

The subject I’m getting back to again and again nowadays is agile for
the whole project. In my opinion agile thoughts often come from
development and never gets a good foothold in the analysis/requirements
or in the testing departments. “Yes, by all means… Do this *agile* you
like so much but please let us write the specs and test cases as we
always have done.” – is a common reasoning where I’ve been.

OK – on to the story. It comes in two flavors, set in in two different
companies; Waterfalling Inc. and Agilement Corp.  They are in the same
place in their project – about to start development and we will see two
different approaches to tackle that. Let’s visit Waterfalling Inc.
first.

And yes, the names, persons and events in this story are all fictional
and just freak of my own imagination…

### Waterfalling Inc.

Sven is rushing. He has called this meeting with the tester in charge
for the project, Johan, AND Marcus – the solution architect. Just to get
hold of an hour where they wasn’t booked wasn’t easy but to then be late
will not improve the meeting climate. Sven swipes into the small room
just in time to see Johan and Marcus take their seats. Great – he made
it.

“Well I’m happy that we’ve finally reached this point” - Sven starts,
and continues:
”As you might know or not, we have been slaving away for quite some time
on this project here at the requirements department”.

Johan and Marcus looks tried. They look at each other with a kind of
here-we-go-again-face.

“Yes, just to get hold of these users are often very hard. They are so
busy. This system will really help them I hope. Would have been great to
meet them more, but two half-day workshops was all they could spare” -
Sven explains.
”Any-who… now we have compiled their thoughts and understanding of the
current system into, if I can say it myself, quite a impressive
requirements document. It 400 pages worth!”. Was that a small whistling
Sven heard from Marcus?

After a moments silence Johan cuts in:
”Well we in the test team haven’t been sleeping either. We sat in on the
first meeting with the customer and then went on to book meeting of our
own. With the first draft of the use cases in hand we have created a
whole lot of test cases. There is a lot of different paths to cover in
this system, you know”

Sven interrupts: “Which users did you meet with? Anders and Cilla?”
”No, it was Gunilla and Madde actually” – Johan replies, “but they work
with the same thing, don’t they?”
”Yeah, I'm sure they are in tune with each other.”, Sven says.

Finally it’s Marcus turn. How often is this part neglected, he thinks.
If you don’t think these IT-things and early decisions through they will
become a mess later on.
“And for our part, the technical side of things, we have also been doing
important stuff. There’s a lot of technical and architectural stuff that
needs to be decided long before any code is actually written.” - he
states with small amount of professor in his tone.

Seeing that he has caught their attention he continues:
”For example, the architectural standards that we need to adhere here at
the company, naming convention and the layering of the system. We have
actually implemented a first run through of the all the layers in the
application that will serve as an example. Nothing we will use in the
real system but just for trying stuff out. “

“With that in hand we can safely pass all of the reviews that the
IT-department makes us go through. That has been the goal for our work
so far…”

“Well then, “ Sven try to stop Marcus before this turns in to
techno-babble “ do you think you can build the system from these
requirements? And the obligatory question – When is it done?”

Marcus: “I cannot see any problems here… You guys seems to have thought
of everything.Just the amount of pages before me is testament alone to
that.”
”As for the estimate – I’d say three months… five at most. Not counting
testing and bug fixing of course”.

Sven looks at Johan who responds; “No but we often calculate just the
developing time divided with PI, which gives us about a month to test
this.”

Sven concludes the meeting: “It sounds about right. Lets finally start
creating the system! And hey, Good luck!”

### Agilement Corp

Steve is rushing. He has called this meeting with John and Mark and he
knows that they both just arrived to the project. Steve wants to make a
first good impression. He even bought cookies for the meeting. As he
enters the team room he sees John and Mark on their way back from the
coffee machine.

“OK – guys want to sit down to discuss our initial thoughts on how to
tackle this system.”
”I rather stand in front of a whiteboard – easier to visualize my
thought there”, John suggests.
“Great idea” it comes back almost in unison from Steve and Mark.

Steve starts; “Ok, we have now interviewed the users of the application
and got a pretty good idea on what they need. Unfortunately they will
not be able to be part of our team. But they have promised to put one or
two people to our disposal an hour a day. So we’ll have to batch up our
questions for a day. We thought that it was acceptable. What’s your
thoughts?”

“If that what they have – that’s what we’ll have to accept.”, Mark
injects.

“OK”, Steve continues, “ for starters I think that the team that has
done the interviews will do just fine. And then we’ll use the customer
hour each day to check back with them”.

“So how do we do this then?” – Steve put the question out.

“Let’s try to specify the system with acceptance criteria's”, John calls
out… a bit too loud maybe. “It was something I read about a time ago
that sounded very interesting I thought.”
”The whole idea is that you start out from a user story as we usually do
but then you write down some example scenarios that in essence is the
acceptance criteria's for that user story. For example from a
<a href="http://blog.dannorth.net/whats-in-a-story/"
target="_blank">great blog post by Dan North</a>”

John walks up to the board and write the following down:

> `Story: Account Holder withdraws cash`
>
> `As an Account Holder``I want to withdraw cash from an ATM``So that I can get money when the bank is closed`
>
> `Scenario 1: Account has sufficient funds``Given the account balance is \$100``  And the card is valid``  And the machine contains enough money``When the Account Holder requests \$20``Then the ATM should dispense \$20``  And the account balance should be \$80``  And the card should be returned`

“Alright – now we’re talking” – Mark joins in. “That will become both
our specification to code against and our acceptance criteria for
verifying the feature afterward.”
“And regression test as the system grows” – John adds.

“Fine, fine my young padawans! Get back to earth you two” – Steve is not
yet impressed.
“How do we go about creating all those user stories and scenarios? All
we have now is high level feature overview. It’s nowhere near the detail
level you are talking about”
”OK, but some of those features are understood at a level where we can
start to create user stories from them, right?” – Mark starts.
”Yeah, I guess”, it comes reluctantly from Steve.
”And we certainly don’t want to specify the whole system at once. Now do
we?” – Mark is walking dangerously close to being patronizing now.

“Well, a suggestion might be to start out with one of those feature and
try to sit down and write user stories and specification for them” –
Johns saves Mark from an awkward moment. And continues:
“That can be done in a workshop with a team with all our three
disciplines; requirement, test and development. And the final result can
be double checked with the customer.”

”OK – I’m getting you now…Something like this maybe?” – Steve steps up
to the whiteboard and draws the following picture:

“All disciplines that are needed to figure out how the feature is to be
implemented meet up in a workshop. They all bring their understanding of
the problem and any documentation they need to remember what’s been said
in earlier discussions.” – Steve explains as he draws.

“Yes”, Mark injects - “and the beauty of that is that the workshop will
produce a single document with the shared understanding of the problem.
It’s all very DRY – Don’t repeat yourself – as any programmer would say.
”
”And! We’re creating the test cases at the same time as we are creating
the specification.” – John adds.
“And! It’s documented in a format that we can show and talk about with
our end users. They will surely understand plain English, won’t they. No
more explaining state diagrams…”

Steve adds the customer to the drawing:

[<img

title="specws2"

They stood back for a while – very satisfied with their progress. But
John, being the skeptical one of the lot wasn’t all happy. Something was
nagging him. Suddenly he realized what it was:
“But hey… you surely doesn’t suggest that we will write these scenarios
perfectly the first time. Or even find all variants of them? Then we
will just be back in a waterfall process again. Although smaller
waterfalls.”

“Of course not “ – Mark said – “but then we could just add more
scenarios as we develops understanding of the problem. Or as we see
stuff that is needed for understanding the function. Or stuff that we
won’t to test.”
”The document will be a living document that we’re working on through
the course of the project or at least feature”

All of a sudden Andrea, one of the young hot-shot programmers approaches
the group:
”I’m sorry – I couldn’t help but overhearing what you where talking
about. I just found this tool called
<a href="http://www.specflow.org" target="_blank">SpecFlow</a> that
could execute scenarios written in the syntax you have described.”

The group goes silent. Andrea continues very slowly.
”Well… I just thought that … we maybe could run those… scenarios against
our daily build and … maybe… get a automatic run through on our
features. As we go…” – he stops here. Was that to bold?

She soon finds out that is was not, when the three men starts to laugh
and dance around her.

Steve sums it up: “Let’s call it a day! We cannot get further today I
think. Drinks are on me”

### Conclusion

And we’re back in the real world. OK, that felt quite cheesy a times,
but I for one realized a lot of stuff while writing this. Actually I
have been at Waterfalling in many projects. They still exists today. I
promise.

The way I suggest here is one way to go and is based on the works of
<a href="http://blog.dannorth.net/" target="_blank">Dan North</a> and
<a href="http://gojko.net/" target="_blank">Gojko Adzic</a> and others.
SpecFlow is an execellent tool to implement the suggested approach on
the .NET platform.
