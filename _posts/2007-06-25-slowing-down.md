In Sweden most people enjoy at around four weeks of summer leave from
their work. Since you can take this leave whenever you want during the
summer the "slow" period tend to drag out.

Also we start to think about that period or at least plan for it long
ahead of it.

But not here, I can tell you! (for real). We have been hacking away in a
furious tempo at work and
rounding up some things from the moving. And then there is the wedding
of Elins
sister this weekend...

Been busy - so not that many blog post has been produced. But
then again - now I can still claim that I only write when I have
something interesting to say... Like this
post ;)
