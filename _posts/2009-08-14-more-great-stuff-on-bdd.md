I have been doing some more reading on
<a href="http://dannorth.net/introducing-bdd" target="_blank">BDD</a>,
and I like it more and more, the more I read about it. I am working from
my house today and Elin is getting a bit annoyed from every time I call
out “Yes”, or when I am trying to explain how good this is.

The main thing for me, right now, is that using the BDD-technique gives
you a way to derive the requirements in a iterative and exploring way.
And in the language of the experts (the ubiquitous language).

I also is fond of the strict structure of a story and it’s scenario that
<a href="http://dannorth.net/" target="_blank">Dan North</a> describes
in <a href="http://dannorth.net/whats-in-a-story" target="_blank">this
article</a>. Mainly because it gives you guidance in the process (“what
is the next important thing the system doesn’t do”). Here are some <a

target="_blank">other reasons</a> from
<a href="http://blog.mountaingoatsoftware.com/" target="_blank">Mike
Cohn</a>

Being strict and formal it also lends itself to automation, like these
