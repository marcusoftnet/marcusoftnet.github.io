I’ve been diving deeper into [BDD](http://dannorth.net/introducing-bdd), and the more I explore it, the more I like it. Today, working from home, I’ve been frequently exclaiming “Yes!” or enthusiastically explaining the benefits of BDD to Elin, who’s starting to get a bit annoyed.

What stands out for me is that BDD provides a way to derive requirements iteratively and exploratively, using the experts' language (the ubiquitous language).

I also appreciate the structured approach to stories and scenarios described by [Dan North](http://dannorth.net/) in [this article](http://dannorth.net/whats-in-a-story). This structure offers clear guidance on what to tackle next in the system. [Mike Cohn](http://blog.mountaingoatsoftware.com/) outlines [other advantages](http://blog.mountaingoatsoftware.com/advantages-of-the-as-a-user-i-want-user-story-template) of using the “As a user, I want…” user story template.

The strict and formal nature of BDD also makes it well-suited for automation, as demonstrated by [these guys](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/joe_ocampo/archive/2007/11/30/bdd-macro-and-template-usage-screencast.aspx).
