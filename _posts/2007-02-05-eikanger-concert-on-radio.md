A
week, or so, ago the Eikanger-Bj√∏rsvik Musikklag
([http://www.ebml.no](http://www.ebml.no/)) went to Britain to take part
of the RNCM Festival of Brass together with the top bands of Britain.

This is the top band in the world as far as I am concerned and they got
some marvelous reviews, see
<http://www.4barsrest.com/reviews/concerts/con381.asp>. Also I have
heard that Elgar Howarth went on stage and told the band "Now I can die,
this was the best concert I ever attended!"...

So if you want to hear it find it here on Wednesday and (hopefully) for
a while afterwards also
