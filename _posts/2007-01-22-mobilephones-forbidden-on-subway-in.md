Just so that you know where you read it first...

Since the start of the year the company running the subway and buses in
Stockholm, [SL](http://www.sl.se/) has
banned mobile phones on the first and
last wagon (of three!) in all subway trains. Note that it doesn't mean
"have your mobile on silent mode" but rather "don't **talk** in your
mobile at all".

This is so stupid! What is next - you can't talk at all in wagon 1?

Extra funny is that ="blsp-spelling-error" onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)">SL
really are plugging the mobile as a great way of communicating with
them. A lot of efforts has been put in to set up sites and portals for
mobiles. Very nice then that you can't use it on the trains and buses...

I bet that we will laugh at this in a year or so. So - as I said at the
top: here is where you read it first. Don't forget it
