I been involved in many meeting booking activities during the last
month. And it’s always the same – you send dates back and forth and
finally decide.

If you have read
<a href="Lean%20Software%20Development" target="_blank">Lean Software
Development</a> by the
<a href="http://www.poppendieck.com/" target="_blank">Poppendiecks</a>
you know about

target="_blank">Set-based problem solving</a>.

The
<a href="http://whenisgood.net/" target="_blank">WhenIsGood</a>-website
uses this approach to decide on an available meeting time, in a very
simple and low-impact fashion. Look for yourself at their

video</a>.
