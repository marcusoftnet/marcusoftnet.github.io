Over the past month, I've been involved in numerous meeting scheduling activities. The process always seems to involve a lot of back-and-forth with dates before finally settling on one.

If you’ve read *[Lean Software Development](https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Software-Development-Integrated-Principles/dp/097778030X)* by the [Poppendiecks](http://www.poppendieck.com/), you’re familiar with the concept of [Set-based Problem Solving](http://www.targetedconvergence.com/setbasedthinking.html).

The website *[WhenIsGood](http://whenisgood.net/)* utilizes this approach to simplify the process of finding a mutually convenient meeting time. It’s a straightforward, low-impact tool that can help streamline scheduling. You can check out their [introduction video](http://whenisgood.net/Videos) to see how it works.

This tool is a practical example of applying set-based problem-solving to everyday tasks, making the scheduling process more efficient and less frustrating.
