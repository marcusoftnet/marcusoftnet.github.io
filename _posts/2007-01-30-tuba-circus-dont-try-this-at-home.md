OK - found this on a site and it just blew my mind!

I've actually heard that piece with
<a href="http://www.baadsvik.com/" target="_blank">Ã˜ystein Baadsvik</a> before but it
still amazing.

For all non-brass players - this is more or
less impossible stuff. Imagine a footballer doing a tripple-salkov and kicking a basketball
into the top corner of a goal from 200 meters - and you are close in how
hard this is.
