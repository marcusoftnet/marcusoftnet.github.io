OK - found this on a site and it just blew my mind!

I've actually heard that piece with [Ã–ystein Baadsvik](http://www.baadsvik.com/) before but it still amazing.

For all non-brass players - this is more or less impossible stuff. Imagine a footballer doing a triple back-flip and kicking a basketball into the top corner of a goal from 200 meters - and you are close in how hard this is.
