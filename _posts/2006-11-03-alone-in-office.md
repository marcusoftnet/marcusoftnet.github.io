Today it's the day before a holiday in Sweden. That means that most
people either don't work at all or that they work half the day.

But .... you've guessed it. As a consultant those rules don't apply. We
don't work half days which i think is a good think - but what i don't
think is a good thing is to be left all alone in the office. I am
struggling to keep the tempo up.
