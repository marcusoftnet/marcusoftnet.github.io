I found [this great article](http://sdesmedt.wordpress.com/2009/05/21/for-once-and-for-all-delegates-events-anonymous-methods-and-lambda-expressions/) about events, delegates, and anonymous methods.

These topics can be quite confusing, especially with modern syntax like [lambda expressions](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397687.aspx). It's challenging to make sense of something like `() => { }` at first glance.

The article by [S. Desmedt](http://sdesmedt.wordpress.com) offers a clear explanation and includes many links for deeper exploration. If you're struggling with these concepts, this resource is a great starting point.
