I found this <a
href="http://sdesmedt.wordpress.com/2009/05/21/for-once-and-for-all-delegates-events-anonymous-methods-and-lambda-expressions/"
target="_blank">great article</a> about events, delegates and anonymous
methods.

I always get lost in these matters and now-a-days you can have some
really funky syntax with
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397687.aspx"
target="_blank">lambdas</a> and everything (I mean who can honestly say
that: “() =\> { }” is read- and understandable. Honestly).

OK –
<a href="http://sdesmedt.wordpress.com" target="_blank">this guy</a>
(can’t find his name) has done an <a
href="http://sdesmedt.wordpress.com/2009/05/21/for-once-and-for-all-delegates-events-anonymous-methods-and-lambda-expressions/"
target="_blank">excellent write-up</a>, with lots of links to other
places if you want to go deep (but that’s really deep, bottomless if you
want).
