<p>I ran into trouble when I tried to use Session-state in an <a href="http://www.asp.net/mVC/" target="_blank">ASP.NET MVC</a> application. </p>  <p>The hit came when I tried to write a unit test for the Action-method that stored stuff in the Session-object. </p>  <p>For a short while I found myself pondering that, but then I ran home to mummy – <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/MVCContrib" target="_blank">MVC Contrib</a>. My God – they have much useful in there. </p>  <p>The thing that save me this time was the <a href="http://mvccontrib.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=TestHelper&amp;referringTitle=Documentation" target="_blank">TestHelper</a>, that solved exactly my problem. </p>  <p>Installed in three minutes and up and running again in five. Great!</p>
