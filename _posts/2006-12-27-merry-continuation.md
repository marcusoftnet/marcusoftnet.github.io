Back from a
relative short holiday-season I am almost alone in the office. Today
will be spent in Word, fleshing out the solution from the day before
Christmas. It will actually be quite fun (?) even though You can't say
that as a hacker.

Here is a nice little game for the season: <http://www.linerider.com/>

And here are some people with to much free time on their hands. But try
the game first so You know what kind of effort has been done.
