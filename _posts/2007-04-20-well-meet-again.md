At my new customer (a big insurance company in Sweden) I have met so many friends and people I know from the past, that I am just amazed over how small Sweden is. Or IT in Sweden are a more correct way of putting it.

Here is a small list of people I've met so far:

- First day - met a friend that I knew from my first IT-job, at Skandia.  Henrik something. I haven't seen him since I stopped work there in 1999
- Second day - learned and met the chief business architect for my project... He is my neighbor from a year back. He met me the first time when I locked myself out and tried to pry the door open. He helped...
- Third day - met a friend from university that I hung with for the major part of the time there. We haven't seen each other since maybe 2000 or so.

So - I am looking forward to continue here and see how else work here, that I know. Maybe they all are friends of me?
