At my new customer (a big insurance company in Sweden) i have met so
many friends and people i know from the past, that i am just amazed over
how small Sweden is. Or IT in Sweden are a more correct way of putting
it.

Here is a small list of people <span>="blsp-spelling-corrected">I've</span> met so far:

-   First day - met a friend that i knew from my first IT-job, at <span
    id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-error">Skandia</span>.
    Henrik something. I haven't seen him since i stopped work there in
    1999
-   Second day - learned and met the chief business architect for my
    project... He is my <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_2"
    class="blsp-spelling-corrected">neighbour</span> from a year back.
    He met me the first time when i locked myself out and tried to pry
    the door open. He helped...
-   Third day - met a friend from university that i hung with for the
    major part of the time there. We haven't seen each other since maybe
    2000 or so.

<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_3" class="blsp-spelling-error">Sooo</span> - i
am looking forward to continue here and see how else work here, that i
know. Maybe they all are friends of me?
