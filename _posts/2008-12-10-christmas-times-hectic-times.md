A very hectic time is closing into an end... the day after tomorrow will
be the first day in ten days that I've been free after work. Phew! To
much!

But fun stuff too:

-   We did two concerts with my Salvation Army Corps and they were both
    great. The [Vasa Band](http://www.vasaband.se/) and [Vasa
    Gospel](http://www.vasagospel.com/) holds these concerts each year.
    This year at our newly renovated corps. I was in the planning group
    as well as doing the presentations during the concert. Very fun!
-   This weekend was another highlight since I ([once
    again](http://www.marcusoft.net/2006/12/marcus-presenter.html)) was
    presenter for the Lucia-concerts of the [Windcorp Brass
    Band](http://www.windcorpbrassband.se/). This year I even got the
    opportunity to play with them due to a late change in the parts.
    Also the guest soloist was [Richard
    Marshall](http://www.richardmarshall.info/) of the [Black Dyke
    Band](http://www.blackdykefanclub.co.uk), which is a bit like a
    football player that get to meet David Beckham! A great thrill for
    me. What a great guy and what a marvelous player!
