So - the
end of 2007 is closing in and it is time to do some retrospectives. I
always find it fun to look back and see what have happened
during the last year. Here are some highlights (or important stuff) that
happened in my life during
2007.


-   We are going to have a
    [baby!](http://marcushammarberg.blogspot.com/2007/08/baby-for-real.html)
    And it's soon - <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_2"
    class="blsp-spelling-corrected">January 2008
-   [Moved](http://marcushammarberg.blogspot.com/2007/05/movinging-in.html)
    to a bigger <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_3"
    class="blsp-spelling-corrected">apartment
-   Became a certified
    [SCRUM-master](http://marcushammarberg.blogspot.com/2007/09/scrum-bringing-fun-back-to-development.html)
    and got to run several SCRUM-projects
-   I was involved in building my best application to date - with a
    great bunch of people
-   [The Vasa corps
    Band](http://marcushammarberg.blogspot.com/2007/11/vasaband-my-band.html)
    of the Salvation army has really come to a <span
    id="SPELLING_ERROR_5"
    class="blsp-spelling-corrected">renaissance. We have a
    wonderful fellowship, we are doing thing for the right reason and
    the band plays quite good also
-   I was in the group the made the ["Vasak√•rens
    Jul"-concert](http://marcushammarberg.blogspot.com/search?q=vasak%C3%A5rens+jul)
    at Nybrokajen 11 - and it was a hit.
-   I [was
    compere](http://marcushammarberg.blogspot.com/2007/12/weekend-report-part-2.html)
    at the Windcorp Christmas concerts
-   On the sad side - [Bengt Eklund](http://marcushammarberg.blogspot.com/2007/04/bengt-eklund.html)
    was "promoted to glory". The funeral was so hard on a lot of us - i
    got the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_10"
    class="blsp-spelling-corrected">opportunity to be host for
    the reception afterwards. This was not fun but felt very good to do.
-   I decided to become Sergent major at the <span
    id="SPELLING_ERROR_11" class="blsp-spelling-error">Vasa
    Corps. This a role that has a lot to do with people and God - and i
    think i finally found a role that suites me (that is without and
    administrative or economical <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_12"
    class="blsp-spelling-corrected">responsibilities)

Finally - i still have a lot of very good friends, a challenging and
mostly fun job, the best family and i am blessed in everything i do. So
that pretty much sums it up - a GREAT year is to an end. And the next
one will be even better....
