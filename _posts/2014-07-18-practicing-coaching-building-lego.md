I've just concluded a vacation during which I had time to build a lot of
Lego (tm) with my sons. That's really a lot of fun and very developing
for the kids I notice. With my oldest, Albert, we have much fun
following description and building the house to the left.
My other sons more like to build something that just comes up with the
pieces they have in hand.

After sitting with Albert a couple of hours I started to recognise the
personality the Lego building brought forth in me; this was
coaching-Marcus talking.

I think this is a really good exercise and in this short post I'll show
you a couple things that I noticed and that was very eye-opening for
me.

### How to run this ... exercise

The whole thing is quite simple. Get a Lego model that you and a kid you
have close. I did this with my own kids, but you can "borrow" one. Just
ask permission or it all end up strange and a bit criminal :). Below I
named my son "the kid".

Then bascially just build the model. I try not to touch the Legos as an
exercise for myself and also try to involve my sons more and more in the
goals, and the plans on how we're going to build. This will be a gradual
process that have to do with experiences of Lego-building you and your
kid have.

Now, the most important part, is that you afterwards reflect on your
behaviour. What worked? What failed? What do you call failure? What does
the kid call failure?

What felt good? What felt bad? When did you have most fun? When did you
see progress in how the kid acted and understood? What did you say to
reach that point? And other questions like that.

### My reflections

I quickly got hold of the instructions book and read from it. Meaning
that my son didn't really understand how to read these instructions.

In the beginning of our building project I was giving very explicit
instructions; "get a 2x2 piece and put it here \[pointing to the
place\]".

- After awhile I took another approach describing what we were about
    to do: "Now we are going to build the balcony"
- I also suggested that we get the right pieces first and then could
    ask him if he could see where they should go

I was very bad indeed in allowing him to make misstakes; "No! That's the
wrong place for that piece, it will be crooked". It was really really
hard for me seeing problems without correcting them immediately.

During the entire build Albert kept talking about how wonderful the
thing would be to use when it was completed.

In the end I gave Albert small projects of his own; "Here build the bed
and then put it in the right place, as shown on the description". He
grew more confident by the minute from that, and started to do more and
more on his own.

As a final exercise I let Albert instruct me. He found that hard and but
fun since he could tell me off :)

Now, I know that building is just for the fun of it. And we sure had fun
(that specific model is really cool as well because it can be rebuilt in
3 different ways). These reflections was just something that popped into
my head as we went along.

The analogies I drew from this was when I have done very hands-on
coaching, showing people new techniques or tools. My two best advices
for that kind of things are:

- Step away from the ~~Legos~~Â keyboard. Let the person you are
    teaching be the driver
- Always ask the person to restate the reason for Why you are doing
    what you are doing right now. Maybe, just maybe, there are ways to
    do this that you didn't think off. Would you want to be the one
    holding back the creativity of new stars?

PS

I of course have to show the finished product.
