<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">

I got a <a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2014/03/mnb-mongoosejs.html"
target="_blank">comment from a reade</a>r. That's both encouraging and
educating. Mr Robert Larsson asked me if I could show him and others how
to write an API using
<a href="http://www.koajs.com/" target="_blank">Koa Js</a>. Yes, sir. I
can do that.

I thought that I would try something different (for me) and did a
screencast out of this. I had great fun doing this and it was a bit
nervous to record this (would the internet act up, would any dogs or
cats outside my house be audible), but the end result was pretty good I
think (Elin opened our VERY squeaky door twice but other than that it
came across fine.

Please let me know what you think about the

As always I learned a lot in the process, here's a few of the things
that I picked up;

-   Rehearse it! Did the complete app 4 times before recording. And
    restarted the recording 2 times
-   Write down key sentences. In this screencast I found myself looking
    for words (non-blocking was one of them) a couple of times. 
-   Don't use too many files and flip back and forth too much. Not too
    happy about that in this case, but I also wanted to show the
    structure I have been using
-   Publish the code
-   Make sure the resolution is good enough to read code. This works in
    full screen but I'm not sure about the smaller screens...
-   Turn updates off...
