We're back home again from Ethiopia. The trip was truly something extra. As I heard someone say: "Africa is more of everything - the worst as well as the best" – this trip has really taken its toll.

We had some amazing experiences but also faced some really hard times. One challenge was keeping track of what Albert put into his mouth. There are so many things that you wouldn’t even want to touch, and he gladly put them into his mouth. He also was sick for most of the trip, nothing too serious but still concerning.

We went on two great tours: one to the south, [Wondo Genet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wondo_Genet), and one to the east, [Ambo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambo,_Ethiopia), of [Addis Ababa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addis_Ababa). The rest of the time was spent in Addis.

I’ll upload some (many?) photos as I get the time. Right now, we're taking care of Elin, who is still sick from something she caught down there.

Great to be back in Sweden!
