I went to a short concert last afternoon with the Hendon band. This is one of the
biggest bands in the Salvation and maybe elsewhere. So i had prepared
for a real "earcleaner" but to my big <span

they managed to play very controlled and balanced.

Strong, yes for sure, but also very soft where needed. Great to hear.
Cornet-soloists was amazing and the tuba
section was so nice to hear. A soft, dark sound with much richness and
really led the band.

So - if you ever have the possibility to hear this band,
don't get scared by the size. There are some very good quality sounds to
be heard from the band.
