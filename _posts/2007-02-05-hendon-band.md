I went to a short concert last afternoon with the <span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-error"
onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)">Hendon</span> band. This is one of the
biggest bands in the Salvation and maybe elsewhere. So i had prepared
for a real "<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-error"
onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)">earcleaner</span>" but to my big <span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">surprise</span>
they managed to play very controlled and balanced.

Strong, yes for sure, but also very soft where needed. Great to hear.
Cornet-<span>="blsp-spelling-corrected">soloists</span> was amazing and the tuba
section was so nice to hear. A soft, dark sound with much richness and
really led the band.

So - if you ever have the <span>="blsp-spelling-corrected">possibility</span> to hear this band,
don't get scared by the size. There are some very good quality sounds to
be heard from the band.
