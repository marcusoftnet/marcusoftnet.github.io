I went to a short concert last afternoon with the Hendon band. This is one of the biggest bands in the Salvation and maybe elsewhere. So I had prepared for a real "ear cleaner" but to my big surprise they managed to play very controlled and balanced.

Strong, yes for sure, but also very soft where needed. Great to hear. Cornet-soloists was amazing and the tuba section was so nice to hear. A soft, dark sound with much richness and really led the band.

So - if you ever have the possibility to hear this band, don't get scared by the size. There are some very good quality sounds to be heard from the band.
