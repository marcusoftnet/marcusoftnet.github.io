Really, really in a hurry right now. Cannot withhold these two great links with answers to some very common and annoying problems with Visual Studio Team System) and Team Foundation Server:

- [How to run tests in a build without test metadata files and test lists (.vsmdi files)](http://blogs.msdn.com/buckh/archive/2006/11/04/how-to-run-tests-without-test-metadata-files-and-test-lists-vsmdi-files.aspx)
- [Beware the Team Test VSMDI file](http://blogs.vertigosoftware.com/teamsystem/archive/2006/06/23/Beware_the_Team_Test_VSMDI_file.aspx)
