Together with
<a href="http://www.joakimsunden.com/" target="_blank">Joakim Sundén</a>
and
<a href="http://blog.avegagroup.se/ChristopheAchouiantz/default.aspx"
target="_blank">Christophe Achouiantz</a> I’ve been doing some talks on
Kanban. We have included some practicality in the talk – Build your own
Kanban-board sort of.

For the first few talks I tried to draw as fast as Joakim (in that case)
talked. Not an easy task – try it. And also my drawings were not always
optimal.

So Joakim and I did some stop-motion-action and created slides for this
part instead. It took the better part of a complete day… But the result
was alright I think.

Here are the slides with some short comments to illustrate what we talk
about.
