Together with [Joakim Sundén](http://www.joakimsunden.com/) and [Christophe Achouiantz](http://blog.avegagroup.se/ChristopheAchouiantz/default.aspx) I’ve been doing some talks on Kanban. We have included some practicality in the talk – Build your own Kanban-board sort of.

For the first few talks I tried to draw as fast as Joakim (in that case) talked. Not an easy task – try it. And also my drawings were not always optimal.

So Joakim and I did some stop-motion-action and created slides for this part instead. It took the better part of a complete day… But the result was alright I think.

Here are the slides with some short comments to illustrate what we talk about.
