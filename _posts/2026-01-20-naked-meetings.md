This is a post that could end up causing me problems—or at least being flagged as “not safe for work”—but here we go:

`I've started going naked to meetings!`

To clarify a bit, I've started to go _device_ naked to meetings. In other words - I try, hard, to not bring any of my devices to meetings. If possible. It is hard work being device naked, I can tell you.

Any other interpretation would render disgust and probably me without a job. The social code in Sweden doesn't really allow for your dirty thoughts, dear reader.

What I'm writing here is purely for me and I'm only going to relate my own reasons and experiences but maybe you find some value in this post.

## The problem

I'm old and have been doing this for a long time. But with the rule of chats over emails, AI agents that do my heavy code lifting and note taking etc. I find myself being interrupted and disturbed more and more in meetings.

It has got increasingly worse the last year or so. If I bring my computer ("to take note on") I inevitably end up reading an article, writing a Slack or even coding. Rarely related to the meeting. There. I've said it.

In fact, it's leaking into my private life where I found (I've stopped) myself reading news during rehearsals, or unable to watch a movie without IMDBs trivia section open.

It has to stop. Drastic measures are needed. I'm going naked!

## Going device naked

Yes. I will not bring a device. Not even the phone, if I can avoid it (see [challenges](#challenges) below), to meetings.

I will bring myself, my intellect and my full attention and engagement of the topic at hand. I've already started and found some great changes.

In meetings, I will keep my Work in Process limit to 1; whatever is being talked about

## Benefits

What I've noticed already is that meetings are more interesting than before. I seem to remember more details, (yes, without taking notes) and also _see_ people.

That last part is embarrassing but sure, I've noticed others before. But now that I listen - actually focused - on what they say and do, I connect with them better.

Hopefully my ~~nakedness~~ engagement  will also benefit others, as they have more of my attention.

## Challenges

Here's some of the challenges I've stumbled into, and that you might encounter if you try to be device naked.

### Others

People will look weirdly at you. I've actually met a fellow device nudist (who asked to be anonymous) that was met with a comment like; `Oh? No computer? So you are not working in this meeting then?`

Well, the hope is that it will be an even better meeting, without a computer screen.

### Taking clothes on, but then off again

The first challenge I stumbled into was that I needed my computer or phone. To look up something we need in the meeting, to take notes or to present.

Being device naked is not a rule, it's more of a guideline.

I do what I have to and the ... gulp ... close the lid of the computer again. Without looking at Slack. I'll do that after the meeting.

### Remote nakedness

Most of the meetings that we have today have one or more person being remote. And being naked remotely is really awkward. Being _device_ naked remote is impossible.

What I've found is that having the computer away from me helps from me switching over to another window and coding some unit tests.

I try to avoid having the computer in my lap. I put the phone on another table.

### Notes

`Aha! But how do you take notes then?`, someone asked in the last meeting.

The short answer is that I don't really know. But I see two potential solutions.

1) I take fewer, but focused notes. See [taking clothes on](#taking-clothes-on-but-then-off-again). Or I might use paper. If I'm the notetaker I try to make use of the Focus mode that most OS have built in. I even shut down other apps down.

2) There are so many great note-taking tools now. Especially in meeting tools, they are becoming increasingly good. The best I've seen is the one found in Notion, but you do you.

Then you can put the computer on the side, to take notes for you - while you enjoy the device nakedness and focus. Then spend a few minutes after the meeting picking out the most important things.

### But, but, but - I'm super busy

(No, your dirty mind ran to `butt`. Your mind. Not mine.)

There are some people around me that are engaged in A LOT of things. I see them buzzing around to do different things. Sometimes I'm one of them.

But me being unengaged in a meeting because I'm responding to Slack messages, or writing a comment on document or fixing a Slide - all of those things are not helping this meeting.

It is actually better to skip the meeting, if you cannot be there fully, or attend for awhile, than being half-committed.

You know what, the slides I created during the meeting also suffered from me not focusing on that.

Small burst of focus is better than big bursts of half-ass:ing it.

## Summary

Being device naked is scary at first. And it will feel weird, and you will fail and fall into going full device clothed again.

But I see this effort as me (and you?) giving each other the gift of our full attention. This will lead to better interactions and outcomes of those interactions.

Remember, the goal is not to be device naked. The goal is to have a good interaction.

It has too, right? Otherwise I'm running around naked here for no reason.
