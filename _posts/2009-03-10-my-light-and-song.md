In a few weeks the
<a href="http://www.vasaband.se" target="_blank">Vasa Band</a> will do a
music festival at the <a href="http://www.fralsningsarmen.se/vasakaren"
target="_blank">corps</a>. I will play an euphonium solo and was looking
for something that isn’t played were often.

For a long time, several years actually, I have had the solo part for My
Light and Song (FS 228) in my “collection”, but never dared try to it.

I have actually never heard it played (actually <a
href="http://www.york-brass.com/englisch/artists/artist_randefalk_e.htm"
target="_blank">Patrik Randefalk</a> did play it with the
<a href="http://www.vasaband.se" target="_blank">Vasa Band</a> in the
90th-ies) or recorded.

I’ll try to post a recording here… after 25 march.
