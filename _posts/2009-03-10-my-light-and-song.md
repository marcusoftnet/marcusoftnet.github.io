In a few weeks the [Vasa Band](http://www.vasaband.se) will do a music festival at the [corps](http://www.fralsningsarmen.se/vasakaren). I will play an euphonium solo and was looking for something that isn’t played very often.

For a long time, several years actually, I have had the solo part for *My Light and Song* (FS 228) in my “collection”, but never dared try to play it.

I have actually never heard it played (actually [Patrik Randefalk](http://www.york-brass.com/englisch/artists/artist_randefalk_e.htm) did play it with the [Vasa Band](http://www.vasaband.se) in the 90s) or recorded.

I’ll try to post a recording here… after March 25.

**UPDATED**

This is so sick! [This book](http://books.google.com/books?id=y7UWPZNqmXYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22my+light+and+song%22&source=gbs_summary_s&cad=0) contains all music (kinda) that is available for euphonium. And who has recorded it! Including a reference to recordings by [my father](http://books.google.com/books?id=y7UWPZNqmXYC&pg=PA576&vq=hammarberg&dq=%22my+light+and+song%22&source=gbs_search_s&cad=0).

And [*My Light and Song*](http://books.google.com/books?id=y7UWPZNqmXYC&pg=PA128&vq=my+light+and+song&dq=%22my+light+and+song%22&source=gbs_search_s&cad=0) is recorded. By a Mr. John Butler.

The internet is amazing…
