<p>As I reviewed my work from yesterday I quickly realized that I bit off much to much. I only need to implement the model for the first product backlog item which is: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>As Product Owner I can create a product backlog so that the team knows what is left before the product is done.&#160; Each product backlog item requires at least an ID, description, priority.&#160; Optional are story points (how big is this compared to other) and the possibility to upload a&#160; document with additional business rules</p> </blockquote>  <p>So - true to the XP guidelines to not do more than is absolutely minimum to solve the task at hand, I backtracked and removed a lot of the code I wrote yesterday. I want to see where the TDD and Extreme OOP takes me. </p>  <p>I start each session by reviewing <a href="http://milano-xpug.pbwiki.com/f/10080616-extreme-oop.pdf" target="_blank">those rules</a> in order to really get them to stick. Man - they are though (&quot;Don’t use any classes with more than two instance variables&quot;, gulp).</p>  <p>OK - so what I managed today was simply to get my model for the first story up. Great! I am getting a hang of the TDD-ing. I have also fallen back in love with C#. What a nice language. And the support for TDD in Resharper is great (with the Create Field on other class helper for example).</p>
