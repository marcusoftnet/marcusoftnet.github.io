Tonight a new TV-shop is introduced in Sweden, [Hål i
Väggen](http://www.tv6.se/halivaggen). It's a total rip-off from a
really wacky Japanese TV-show.

Just to set the record straight - [I discovered it
first](http://www.marcusoft.net/2007/07/only-in-japan.html)! Here is the
proof - written Wednesday, July 11, 2007.

So TV6 - send the money to me. I accept checks. ;)

**\[UPDATED\]
**Hehe - spoke to soon! The program wasn't aired until today, Sunday.
Sorry about that - I was still first though...
