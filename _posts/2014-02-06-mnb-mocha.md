When it comes to testing frameworks on the javascript and node stack
it's an abundance of choices, just like for any of your needs. Once
again you need to look around, ask around and make up your mind by
yourself.

The two frameworks that are mentioned the most is
<a href="http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/" target="_blank">jasmine</a> and
<a href="http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/" target="_blank">mocha</a>.
The way you write your tests in these frameworks are very much alike and
the main difference is in how you run them. Jasmine is executed in a
browser (as I understand it) and mocha is run at the terminal, but could
be run in the browser too. I like [the
terminal](http://www.marcusoft.net/2014/02/mnb-terminal.html), as you
know.

Ok, there’s also test runners that isn’t a test framework… like
<a href="http://karma-runner.github.io/" target="_blank">Karma</a>, and
probably some more. These tools run any kind of tests (like jasmine,
mocha or what have you).  At first I tried to use this but when I
realised that mocha comes with a test runner that suited all my needs up
to now. And it was a much easier set up.

I’ve got stuck on mocha since I think the runner is very capable and the
syntax is nice. Finally it was really easy to get started with, where
there are few more pieces to puzzle together with Jasmine.
Mocha is installed with ease, just like any node package, by

> <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">npm
> install mocha.

If you add the “<span
style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">-g” flag
you’ll be able to run mocha tests in any directory. Remember, from my
[package.json-post](http://www.marcusoft.net/2014/02/mnb-mocha.html),
that you should include it in your local node_modules as well. In my
opinion, once you have pulled down a project you should just have to go
“<span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">npm
install” and then be able to run it. No extra steps should be
required. <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;">

### The syntax

The syntax of a mocha (and to be honest most JavasScript testing
frameworks I’ve seen) resembles the Ruby tool
[RSpec](http://rspec.info/). It’s a pretty straight forward API and for
most of your needs you only need to care about 3 to 4 functions:
<span
style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">describe(description,
func) – this is the top level function of your tests. It takes a
string description of the thing that you are describing (or testing if
you have your tester hat on) and then a function with it-statements.
This would be the test fixture in xUnit frameworks.

- These can be nested and we’ll get back to how to  write this without
    going crazy.

<span
style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">it(description,
func) – this is your actual specifications that poke your system
and does tests. The test-methods if you want to compare it with xUnit
style of tests.

<span
style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">beforeeach(func)<span
style="font-family: inherit;">and<span
style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">
before(func) – this is methods that is executed before... Before
what you might ask, well that has to do with where you place them. If
you place them inside a <span
style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">describe<span
style="font-family: inherit;">-block (which is the most common place I
use them) then the <span
style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">beforeEach<span
style="font-family: inherit;">-block is run before each
it-statement. It can also be place outside any <span
style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">describe and
will then be run for all the <span
style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">describe's.
 It suitable for setup of your system under test, for example

<span
style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">aftereach(func)<span
style="font-family: inherit;"> and <span
style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">after(func) –
and there´s a tear down version of course. The same rules goes for
that.

Mocha is much bigger than this, but with these simple api I've managed
most my testing needs so far.

### The done() parameter



One thing that really messed things up for me in the beginning was when
I left out or didn't handle the <span
style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">done-parameter
to my <span
style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">it<span
style="font-family: inherit;">-statements. I think (and will hopefully
be corrected on this if I'm wrong) that mocha runs it's test
asynchronously, as many things are with [Node](http://nodejs.org/). This
means that we need to inform mocha on when our test code is <span
style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">done<span
style="font-family: inherit;">, so that mocha can pick it up again and
process the next test.  




<span style="font-family: inherit;">




<span style="font-family: inherit;">This sounds complicated but in
reality just comes as a parameter to the functions in our <span
style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">describe,
before/after <span style="font-family: inherit;">and<span
style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;"> it<span
style="font-family: inherit;">-statements. That parameter, <span
style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">done<span
style="font-family: inherit;">, is a function that we call when our test
is complete. Like this:

<span style="font-family: inherit;">Failing to call the done-function
will render a timeout exception and you'll faced with an error message
like this:

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

<a
href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hRHgJNQBIiU/Uu4xLbhcCyI/AAAAAAAAB6I/HsWG3V-Asmk/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-02-02+at+18.40.48+.png"
data-imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img
src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hRHgJNQBIiU/Uu4xLbhcCyI/AAAAAAAAB6I/HsWG3V-Asmk/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-02-02+at+18.40.48+.png"
data-border="0" width="640" height="98" /></a>


<span style="font-family: inherit;">


<div style="text-align: left;">

Confused the crap out of me at first. Call <span
style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">done() in
the end of your <span
style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">it-statements
and it goes aways.


### How I write the tests and keep sane counting parentheses

This is just following the way of writing that I sketched out in [this
post](http://www.marcusoft.net/2014/02/mnb-callback.html) but it was
when writing mocha-tests that I first found the great use of writing my
code in this manner. Because, like I said, the describe-functions are
just that; functions. But when a complete test case is written out they
look like something completely different. It's not uncommon that they
end in <span
style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">});});});}); and
everyone is just fine with it.

Let’s take an example ; let’s pretend we’re writing the specifications
for how users behave in our system. This includes the validation and
storage (and probably some more). I would write this like this, in
sequences:

Already at this point you could run the tests. It wouldn’t say much as
result, since there are no real tests in there, but it’s a good check to
see that you haven’t mess things up.
I often fill out empty it-functions for some for the features as well.
This doesn’t against the TDD rhythm of having just one failing test,
since writing the it’s like this will just render them “inconclusive”. I
think it’s a nice way of structuring you’re work and get an overview.
Under each describe I would write stubs for the it-statements, like
this:

Running the test (with <span
style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">mocha -u bdd -R
spec<span style="font-family: inherit;"> see below) like
they are written above produce this nice little output in our console:

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

<a
href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0FaImdy__1c/Uu43EdhHwwI/AAAAAAAAB6g/YqLa0Y5WUIQ/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-02-02+at+19.14.54+.png"
data-imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img
src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0FaImdy__1c/Uu43EdhHwwI/AAAAAAAAB6g/YqLa0Y5WUIQ/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-02-02+at+19.14.54+.png"
data-border="0" width="400" height="292" /></a>


And you’re now ready to start work with your first test.

### Mocha test runner and reporters

The mocha test runner is a command line tool that you run from your
command prompt. The [Visual Studio](http://www.visualstudio.com/) guy in
me is complaining at this fact, but the newly born
[terminal](http://www.marcusoft.net/2014/02/mnb-terminal.html) guy is ok
with it and holds the Visual Studio guys hand (yeah, there’s quite a few
of me in there… should probably do something about that some day).

Ok, the test runner. At it’s core is very simple; go <span
style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">mocha and
it will run all tests (as in “all the .js-files with describe-functions
in them)  in the <span
style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">test
directory. But there’s a [lot of
switches](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/#usage) and here are the
ones that I often use:

<span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">-u
bdd – with this switch you can set the style of writing.
BDD-style means that you write <span
style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">describe
and <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">it
<span style="font-family: inherit;">in your tests, i.e.
what I’ve described above. There’s also “tdd” and “exports” but I
don't use that.

<span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">-R
spec – this is how you want the result of your test execution to
be presented, i.e. the reporter. I like the specification style since it
reads nice, especially if you pay attention to how you formulate and
nest  your specifications. There are loads of other reporters (10+ on my
machine). Noteworthy are:

- <span
    style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">dot -
    .F.. you get it, huh?
- <span
    style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">list -
    writes sentences from your specs
- <span
    style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">markdown -
    that produces markdown pages
- <span
    style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">min - a
    minimal reporter that just gives you number of
    passed/failed/inconclusive

<span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">-w -
this handy little flag starts watching your directory for changes. That
is; it keeps executing the test for each change. I often issue this
command in a separate terminal and keep them running as I go. I have had
some problems getting this command to pick up new files, but a quick
stop-and-go resolves that. And you stop with CTRL+C if you didn´t know
that.

As I said, there
<a href="http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/#usage" target="_blank">are
loads of more switches</a> but these are the ones that I’ve used the
most.
One last thing about switches: if you end up having a lot of them you
can save them in a separate file called <span
style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">mocha.opts
or as a script in your
[package.json](http://www.marcusoft.net/2014/02/mnb-packagejson.html) like
I described before.  Put the mocha.opts file in your test directory and
just enter each switch on a separate line in the file, it’s just a
simple text file.
I've come to favour adding a node under scripts in
the [package.json](http://www.marcusoft.net/2014/02/mnb-packagejson.html) file
and just add the switches there. I often do two scripts <span
style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">npm
test and <span
style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">npm
watch_test. One with the <span
style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">-w-flag and
one without.

I wanted to talk about
[should](http://www.marcusoft.net/2014/02/mnb-should.html) here too but
this post is a bit long already. [Until next
time.](http://www.marcusoft.net/2014/02/mnb-should.html)
