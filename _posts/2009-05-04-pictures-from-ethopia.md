The last week has been quite unusual and busy, as we’re still recovering from an illness we picked up in Africa. Elin has been hit the hardest, but Abbe and I have also felt the effects.

I haven’t had the chance to update the blog recently, but I wanted to share some pictures from our trip.

A typical outing often involved us being followed around. It was a common occurrence throughout our travels.

A building site in Addis Ababa.

The beautiful Wenchi Crater - we walked down to the water...

...and this is how we made our way back up. Yes, that’s me on a horse with Abbe on my back!

On our way home to a friend’s place in downtown Addis.

It was truly a trip of a lifetime! I wouldn’t recommend traveling there with a baby in the oral stage of development, but it didn’t detract from the fantastic experiences and sights we enjoyed.
