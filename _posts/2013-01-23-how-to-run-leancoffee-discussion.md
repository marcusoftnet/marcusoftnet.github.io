On a Sunday night a got a mail that asked me to do a presentation
tomorrow. New client. Want to put best foot forward. :) So I threw one
together and here's the run down of it. Thinking of recording it and put
it up somewhere too.

<a href="http://leancoffee.org/" target="_blank">Lean Coffee</a> is a
way to hold meetings and gathering that allows for free discussions
while still keeping some structure to it. It resembles Open Space
Technology but is much easier to set up and run, and often run in small
groups. Even thought the concept is called Lean Coffee is suitable for
discussing most any subject and topics.

Lean Coffee started in Seattle in 2009. Jim Benson and Jeremy Lightsmith
first Lean Coffee group has inspired a lot of others around the globe.
I've taken part in the one in Stockholm
<a href="http://sumpanleancoffee.wordpress.com/"
target="_blank">LeanKaffeSump</a> quite a few time, but have also run
them as corporate internal event, as well as for meetings of all
sorts.

It doesn't take much to run on. If you have coffee and a couple of
Toyota mugs your halfway there.
Just kidding, of course, but here is a simple recipe on how I usually
run, and have seen them run. Variants are abundant and you should change
it to suit your particular situation.

Here we go:


First get coffee. This is the only required ingredient :)

Invite everybody to write notes with suggestions for topics. They can be
around a theme or freely suggested. You can suggest anything; things you
know, things you don't know, things you know people love to talk about
or things that would cause a stir. The only thing that you agree on
doing by writing a note is to introduce the topic, maybe with a simple
question that you are thinking about.

To get an order of your topics, your agenda if you will, vote among the
suggested topics. We usually do this
by <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/DotVoting.html"
target="_blank">Dot voting</a> on the subjects we like. That's just
giving everybody three dots to distribute freely among the suggested
topics.

Got a tip from my friend
<a href="http://joakimsunden.com/" target="_blank">Joakim</a> on how to
decide the number of dots/votes per person. The number of stickies
divided by 3. 

-   12 stickies / 3 = 4 votes per person. 
-   2 stickies / 3 = ah, well 1 vote per person then. 

When you have an initial order of your topics - start to talk about the
first one. This will be the one that most people in the group wanted to
talk about so you will probably have an interesting first topic.

Use a time box for your discussions to keep them focused and not
dragging on for ever. We usually start a timer, for example, on 10
minutes. When the time is up we vote (thumbs up/down or sideways if your
indifferent to the decision) if we shall continue to talk about the
subject, or go on to the next one on the agenda.

Sometimes it's worth documenting your discussions. We usually let one
person to this as a mind map.

Sometimes it's a good idea to see if the meetings are interesting and
rewarding. Let people vote for Return On Time Invested (1-5, 1 is worst
time of your life, 5 is the paradise)

We go one for as long as we find it interesting. The slogan for
<a href="http://twitter.com/@LeanKaffeSump" target="_blank">Lean Kaffe
Sump</a> is: Come when you can, go when you must.

I have had great use for the
<a href="http://www.leancoffee.org/" target="_blank">Lean Coffee</a>
concept, and used it in a lot of different situations. I hope you found
this introduction useful and that you will start use it to.

Good luck - happy coffee-ing.
