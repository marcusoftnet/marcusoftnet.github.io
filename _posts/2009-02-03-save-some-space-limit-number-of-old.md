Found an option that really saves some space for TDD:ers in Visual
Studio. The test results folder can be limited to a certain number of
test runs. That would really have helped me at my latest project where
my Test Result folder was several Gb.

Go Tools-\>Options-\>Test tools-\>Test execution.

When you first exceed that number you'll be warned that folders will be
deleted - thank you very much!
