<p>I haven’t done <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development" target="_blank">TDD</a> for a very long time and I still am waiting for my first <a href="http://dannorth.net/introducing-bdd" target="_blank">BDD</a> project in real life. In fact I sometimes have a problem to describe the goodness. </p>  <p>But <a href="http://railsenvy.com/" target="_blank">Gregg Pollack</a> has done the same journey as I have and he has also done this great presentation on why TDD is good and how to use it.</p>  

Sadly that video is long gone. Sad, because it was a good presentation. 

<p>This is such a great presentation where he takes us through a series of points that explains the rationale of TDD and then BDD, or the “pathway to developer enlightenment”, as he calls it. I have extracted his points here:</p>  <ol>   <li>Testing breeds <strong>confidence</strong> </li>    <li>If you write tests before you write your code, you end up <strong>writing better code</strong> </li>    <li>Well written tests are just as good, if not <strong>better than documentation</strong></li>    <li>TDD isn’t about writing tests, it's <strong>about defining behavior</strong>.</li> </ol>  <p>Seeing this was like getting help to put words to my own thoughts. Thank you <a href="http://railsenvy.com/2007/10/03/how-i-learned-to-love-testing-presentation" target="_blank">Gregg</a>.</p>  <p>Also – I might have to check out <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/" target="_blank">Ruby</a>. To many people has pointed towards it…</p>
