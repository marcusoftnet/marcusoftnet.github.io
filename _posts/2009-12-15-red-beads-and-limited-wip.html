<p>I attended the second <a href="http://www.limitedwipsociety.org/" target="_blank">Limited WIP Society</a> (Sweden) gathering. It’s a bunch of people that has taken liking in Kanban practices. </p>  <p>This evening <a href="http://www.agilemanagement.net" target="_blank">David J Andersson</a> joined us and he gave a very interesting presentation on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban" target="_blank">Kanban</a> teams reach <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMMI" target="_blank">CMMI</a> 5 level, i.e. ranked as very mature. This is, apparently, not repeated by team doing other agile methods. </p>  <p>OK – during the second half me and <a href="http://www.joakimsunden.com/" target="_blank">Joakim Sundén</a> presented the Red Bead Experiment. Well played it out I think would be a more appropriate word for it. It’s a game that aims to drive home the point Dr. W. Edwards Deming - <a href="http://matthrivnak.com/lean-quotes/" target="_blank">“a bad system will beat a good person every time”</a></p>  <p>If you haven’t seen it before there is an <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/agile-scrum/demings-red-bead-experiment" target="_blank">excellent recording</a> with Benjamin Mitchell and David Joyce.&#160; </p>
