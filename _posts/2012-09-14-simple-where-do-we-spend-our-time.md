I have a confession to make; i think i'm turning into a data-guy.
No, not a computer-guy - I've been that a long time. Rather it's that
boring dude that keep asking for numbers, measurements and saying "yes,
but how do you KNOW that" all the time. But I'm on a program to recovery
from some of the boredom-parts. It's called Simplicity and
Visualisation.

To be a little more serious I think that collecting data and then do
small experiments based upon them rather than you feelings is the way to
make controlled, continuous improvements. This is all very

target="_blank">Kanban Kata</a> or even the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method"
target="_blank">scientific method</a>) like but that's exactly where I'm
aiming.

-   Establish a target condition or goal
-   Make sure you really know where you stand today. Gather data to be
    sure
-   Take small experimental steps towards the goal
-   Measure and evaluate against your goal based on the numbers

<div>

In this post I'll show you how we did a small data gathering that didn't
feel like data gathering at all.




### Why not feel like data gathering?

</div>

<div>

Every time I have introduced the idea of start measuring how we're doing
in lead time, throughput or whatever have you - the first reaction is
always a shudder. "No!? Why? We don't need to show that. We know how
we're doing, right?"

</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>

This probably only show what most of us has been subjected to before;
measurements to be followed by up others, to compare or even affect our
salary. 

</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>

So, let me just make one thing clear here - that's not what i'm talking
about here. I want the TEAM to collect data about the TEAMs performance
to let the TEAM improve upon it as they see possible and fit. (Keyword
in the pervious sentence was TEAM, if you missed it). It's an internal
thing. 

</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>

One easy way to accomplish that, and get many concerns from the team out
of the way, is to let the team pick the scale or figures themselves.
Like story points for example - it's a relative measurement that cannot
be used to compare teams. One team says that a certain task is 8 story
points, another calls the same task Large. Or 5 points. Or whatever.

For the case of this blog post, we went even simpler... 

</div>

### The problem - where do we spend our time 

<div>

I'm coaching a team right now (amazing engineers - best I've worked
with) that are the firefighters of the company. Anything goes wrong in
any backend related stuff - you call them. And they deliver. So you
could say that they are paying off technical debt for the company. 

</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>

But they want to move away from firefighting, reactive work and move
towards proactive work instead. Who can blame them? So they started to.
And they feel like there on the move to doing more Proactive work. Maybe
60% reactive work now. 

</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>

See right there? That's what I mean; But who do we KNOW that guys? Let's
gather some data.

</div>

### The solution - simple and lightweight

<div>

This team is really working me hard. Every suggestion I come up with is
met with healthy amounts of scepsis and their asking me for good
motivations all the time. Thanks team. 

</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>

So we agreed that we wanted something really lightweight but also really
enough that it gave us real data to work from. We devised two
visualizations that helped us with this:

</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>

Firstly all the stickies on the board are just in 2 colors; Reactive
work and other work.

</div>

<div>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

data-border="0" width="320" height="170" /></a>

</div>

</div>

<div>

This means that you can easily take a glance at our board at anytime and
see what's going on that the **current** distribution between reactive
and proactive work

data-border="0" width="320" height="137" /></a>

</div>


To follow up we did a small board on the side (with a HORRIBLE
background color, sorry about that) that is updated by each person
around the daily standup each morning. It simply shows where you spent
your time mostly the day before.

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

data-border="0" width="320" height="212" /></a>

</div>


Yes, we're tracking days that was mostly spent in meetings too, on the
yellow stickies (some people have a hard time making out the color,
hence the Swedish word for yellow, GUL, written on them). Somedays are
swallowed up in meetings, which you can see.
**UPDATE:** We started to track the trends updating them weekly. Here is
how it's spread for the first couple of weeks:

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

<a
href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-F4QVmvVW_sw/UG6a0oehbNI/AAAAAAAABY8/IAsikqTdU1I/s1600/bild+(2).JPG"
data-imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img

data-border="0" width="239" height="320" /></a>

</div>


It's a rolling buffer just showing the last week. We take photos of it a
little now and then to get an overview. So here you can see that during
the last week the distribution was a bit different than before.

### Conclusion

</div>

<div>

With these two simple visualisations we gathering data on how the
distribution really is between the reactive and the proactive work. Note
that lack of exact numbers here. It's deliberate. We hope that the
pictures still gives us an good enough knowledge about the distribution,
and warns us when it goes to far to either way.
