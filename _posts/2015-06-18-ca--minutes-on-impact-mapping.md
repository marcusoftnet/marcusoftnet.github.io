Having your mission, vision and strategy in place are essential but result in nothing, if you can't make sure that you execute them. Can't make sure that you take steps in your strategic plan to get closer to the vision.
One of the best tools I've seen around this, on the strategic level, is called [Impact Mapping](http://www.impactmapping.org/). This presentation is devoted to this tool

Here's all the post in the series (the links will work as I post them):

In this presentation I try to be very practical, as opposed on the previous three where I've been more abstract and high flying. Therefor I start of right away with and example where we create a impact map.

After that it's easier to describe what a impact map is, why it works so great and the theories behind it. For me it's summed up in three words:

* An impact map is Strategic - which is the perfect level to communicate on. It's plan for the upcoming future not the life time of a company. It feels current and easier to grasp than the true meaning of the vision, for example.
* An impact map is Visual - making it apparent and tangible
* An impact map is Collaborative - involving everyone needed to execute the plan, increasing the shared understanding right from the get-go
