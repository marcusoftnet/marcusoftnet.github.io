I still cannot believe that JavaScript has become so big… This is a
language that many of us laughed at just a couple years back – but now
we all stand corrected.

OK, swallowing my pride I am still happy that a number of JavaScript
libraries has emerged so that I don’t have to hack it all by my own.
Again…

One of the most talked libraries about these days is
<a href="http://jquery.com/" target="_blank">JQuery</a>, which I
actually thought was some kind of LINQ-dialect. But even if don’t have
to hack it myself, I still need to learn it. And also
<a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/" target="_blank">CSS</a>
apparently since JQuery works a lot with CSS-classes and stuff.

Luckily there are some great tutorials and screencast (which I happen to
like more) out there. Here is my <a
href="http://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/20-introduction-to-jquery/"
target="_blank">recommended starter</a>. It’s for designers so beware of
some funky words and coolness from the presenter…

And here is another bunch of stuff that has helped me in my
explorations:

- <a href="http://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/35-intro-to-jquery-2/"
    target="_blank">The second part of the screencast above</a>
- <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/" target="_blank">JQuery’s own
    documentation</a>
- And
    <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials" target="_blank">JQuery’s
    tutorials</a>
- <a
    href="http://visitmix.com/Opinions/What-ASPNET-Developers-Should-Know-About-jQuery"
    target="_blank">What ASP.NET developers should know about JQuery</a>
- And since I’m using ASP.NET MVC – here is how to make use of the <a
    href="http://haacked.com/archive/2009/04/14/using-jquery-grid-with-asp.net-mvc.aspx"
    target="_blank">JQuery Grid in ASP.NET MVC</a>

And finally, quite amusing, my good friend
<a href="http://kenlarsson.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Ken</a> did a
<a
href="http://kenlarsson.blogspot.com/2009/11/using-jquery-to-solve-problems_12.html"
target="_blank">blogpost on JQuery</a>. The same day! No relation!
