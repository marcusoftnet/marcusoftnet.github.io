I’m still amazed at how JavaScript has evolved. A language that many of us once dismissed has become a critical part of modern web development. Fortunately, the emergence of various JavaScript libraries means we don’t have to write everything from scratch.

One of the most talked-about libraries these days is [jQuery](http://jquery.com/). Initially, I thought it was just another LINQ dialect, but I quickly realized it’s far more than that. While it spares me from having to hack everything myself, I still need to get up to speed with it—and with CSS, since jQuery heavily interacts with CSS classes and other elements.

Here are some resources that have helped me get started with jQuery:

- [Introduction to jQuery](http://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/20-introduction-to-jquery/): A great screencast for designers. It might have some jargon and a bit of flair from the presenter.
- [The second part of the screencast](http://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/35-intro-to-jquery-2/): Continues from the first part.
- [jQuery Documentation](http://docs.jquery.com/): The official documentation for in-depth information.
- [jQuery Tutorials](http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials): Official tutorials to help you learn the basics and beyond.
- [What ASP.NET Developers Should Know About jQuery](http://visitmix.com/Opinions/What-ASPNET-Developers-Should-Know-About-jQuery): A resource tailored for ASP.NET developers.
- [Using jQuery Grid with ASP.NET MVC](http://haacked.com/archive/2009/04/14/using-jquery-grid-with-asp.net-mvc.aspx): A guide on integrating jQuery Grid into ASP.NET MVC applications.

Additionally, my good friend [Ken](http://kenlarsson.blogspot.com/) coincidentally posted about jQuery on the same day. You can check out his [blog post on jQuery](http://kenlarsson.blogspot.com/2009/11/using-jquery-to-solve-problems_12.html) for another perspective. No planned connection, just a happy coincidence!

Exploring jQuery has been quite an adventure, and these resources have been invaluable in my journey.
