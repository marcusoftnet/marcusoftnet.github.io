I have been <a
href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2008/03/short-conchango-scrum-tfs-template.html"
target="_blank">quite harsh</a> to the
<a href="http://www.conchango.com/" target="_blank">Conchango</a>
<a href="http://scrumforteamsystem.com/en/" target="_blank">Scrum
template</a> for Team Foundation Server, and I actually didn’t like it
when I used it last (8 months ago).

That primarily had to do with me being forced to use the standard,
heavy-weight forms in Visual Studio to edit Backlog Items and Actions.
That did that we couldn’t use it in our daily scrums and hence someone
(read: me) had to take notes and then go an update the TFS. In lean
terms this was <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development#Eliminate_waste"
target="_blank">WASTE</a> that was added to our project. I didn’t like
that one bit. So we stopped using it. Quickly.

But now
<a href="http://www.conchango.com/" target="_blank">Conchango</a> has
created the tool that I think was the missing link. A Task Board
application that mimics the actual task board that you draw and edit
during sprints, planning and daily scrums.

You can
<a href="http://scrumforteamsystem.com/en/TaskBoard/default.aspx"
target="_blank">read more about it here</a> and learn how it works
<a href="http://scrumforteamsystem.com/en/TaskBoard/WebCasts.aspx"
target="_blank">from these videos.</a> Of course I cannot be sure yet,
but it looks very promising, very promising indeed.

All the usual benefits from introducing a IT-support could be found
here; automatic generation of burn down (<a
href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2008/03/conchango-burndown-char-not-showing.html"
target="_blank">will it work?)</a>, the possibility to support
distributed teams better, history, support in calculations and reports
etc.

Give it a try – I know I will. Way to go Conchango!
