I’ve been [quite harsh](http://www.marcusoft.net/2008/03/short-conchango-scrum-tfs-template.html) on the [Conchango](http://www.conchango.com/) [Scrum template](http://scrumforteamsystem.com/en/) for Team Foundation Server in the past, and I didn’t enjoy using it the last time (about 8 months ago).

My main issue was the need to use the standard, heavy-weight forms in Visual Studio to edit Backlog Items and Actions. This made it impractical for daily scrums, so someone (usually me) had to take notes during the meeting and then update TFS afterward. In lean terms, this was pure [WASTE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development#Eliminate_waste) added to our project. I hated that, so we stopped using it quickly.

But now, [Conchango](http://www.conchango.com/) has created a tool that I think fills the gap—a Task Board application that mimics the physical task board you typically use during sprints, planning, and daily scrums.

You can [read more about it here](http://scrumforteamsystem.com/en/TaskBoard/default.aspx) and check out [these videos](http://scrumforteamsystem.com/en/TaskBoard/WebCasts.aspx) to learn how it works. I can’t be sure yet, but it looks very promising, very promising indeed.

The usual benefits of IT support are likely to be found here: automatic generation of burn down (will [it work?](http://www.marcusoft.net/2008/03/conchango-burndown-char-not-showing.html)), improved support for distributed teams, history tracking, and better support for calculations and reports.

Give it a try—I know I will. Way to go, Conchango!
