This
is just to good to be missed...

In my current project I have implemented an automated build process,
which includes some component testing done with NUnit.

Yesterday I also added the use of NCover (<http://www.ncover.org>) which
gives you some idea on how much that was tested. The reports from NCover
is not very easily understood, don't give you any overviews and is not
easy to trace back to the code.

So, with this background my eyes was running with tears when i found
NCoverExplorer. A truly great and useful utility. And good-looking to
:-)

Be sure to get hold of the tool today:

And a big thank you to the "kiwi dude". Great stuff!
