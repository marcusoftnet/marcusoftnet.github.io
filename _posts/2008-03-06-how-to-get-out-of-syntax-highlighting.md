One of the most annoying thing with VB.NET is when it tries to help you with syntax highlighting, when using snippets.

You know; you type "property" hit TAB and then the property is created for you. The things that you needs to "fill out" is highlighted with some scary green color (see picture above).

In Visual Studio:

- After the snippet is filled out position the cursor after end property
- Hit `ENTER`
- The green coloring is gone

If anyone know how to do this in Visual Studio 2005 I would love to know. I'll buy you a cup of coffee at Länsförsäkringar, level 4. I promise
