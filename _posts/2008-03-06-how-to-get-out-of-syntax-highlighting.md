<div>

One of the most annoying thing with VB.NET is when it tries to help you
with syntax highlighting, when using snippets.

</div>


<div>

You know; you type "property" hit TAB and then the property is created
for you. The things that you needs to "fill out" is highlighted with
some scary green color (see picture above).

</div>


<div>

In Vis
-   After the snippet is filled out position the cursor after end
    property
-   Hit ENTER
-   The green coloring is gone
If anyone know how to do this in Visual Studio 2005 i would love to
know. I'll buy you a cup of coffee at Lansforsakringar, level 4. I
promise
