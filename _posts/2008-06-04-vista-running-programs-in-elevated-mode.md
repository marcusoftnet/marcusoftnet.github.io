I just ran into an problem with installing a program on my Vista
machine. That particular program needed to be installed from "an
elevated command prompt". That is; a command prompt running as
administrator.

There are a number of ways to do this and they are all covered <a
href="http://www.tipandtrick.net/2008/how-open-command-prompt-as-administrator-on-elevation-in-vista/"
target="_blank">here</a>. That article talks about how to run the
command prompt in an elevated mode and my favorite trick is to:

-   type CMD in Start-\>Run...
-   hit CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER - which is the shortcut to run things as
    administrator
-   Viola! - you're running as admin ;)
