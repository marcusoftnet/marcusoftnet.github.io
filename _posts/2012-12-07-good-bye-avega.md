Today is the last day I work for [Avega
Group](http://www.avegagroup.se/). It's the best place I ever worked at
to date. I've been there for almost 8 years and see the company grow
from 50 people to about 400 people.

During this time I've learned a lot from a lot of amazing people. I've
grown as person and in my career to someone that I never thought that I
could be. A lot of this has been due to the support Avega and all the
people there have given me.

To say good bye properly I recorded a little (8 mins) movie with some
memories from the Avega office that I will carry with me forever. It's
in Swedish so for all you english people (68% according to Google
Analytics) I'm sorry about that, but this one goes out to
my colleagues at Avega.

<span style="text-align: left;">Avega - I love you!

I've had the time of my life - I hope you have too!

The world is not so big - we'll probably run into each other out there.
A lot I hope!
Bye for now.
