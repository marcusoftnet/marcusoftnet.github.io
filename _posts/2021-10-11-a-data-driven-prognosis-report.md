I have a big project ahead here at [Salt](https://www.salt.dev) - I'm going to write an entire boot camp from scratch. This is done as a single-person project and all my other colleagues are working on as normal around me. 

I wanted to report my progress to them so that they know what's happening and also that I can get some leeway of keeping my focus. 

In this post, I wanted to share a very simple prognosis tool that I created based on the data that my work create. As always, it's not perfect but it will give an accurate  enough feel for where I am and [when it will be done](https://leanpub.com/whenwillitbedone)

## A few words about the project

Unlike most software development projects I've been in the scope of this project is *very* clear; 

* I'm going to write slides, labs, and instructions for 13 weeks, 5 days a week
* The topic is given
* The content on heading level per week is given (after some initial vetting work with external consultants).

So ... all that is left is to fill out the blank. Well, it's not that simple, but I have to ensure that I managed to fit the content. 

What I did is that I listed all days (and weeks) for the entire boot camp and then created a status for each day:

1. Documentation initialized
2. Heading of the week created
3. Heading of days created
4. Content stubbed out
5. Slides written
6. Lab/test written
7. Ready to go

I also added one more property per day: completion in 15%. I use this to indicate how much work is left to do on the day. Stubbing out the content for the day takes a very short time. While writing slides or the labs take considerably longer. 

With that in hand, I was ready to create some reporting

### Simple reporting

The most simple thing I could do was to add a report for how all of these numbers add up. This was things like a circle diagram showing how far I've come

Or just showing per week how much has reached 100%

![Completion per week](/img/DNFSCompletionPerWeek.png)

This is good and probably interesting but doesn't say anything about when I will be done. The works I've done so far is the easy part. I could copy just about everything from other sources. 

But let's try to fix that - time to get prognosticate (no .. that is not right... time to make a data-driven prognosis)

## Prognosis

Here's the thing, I do know, how far I've come right now. And after each day I work, I know how far I've come so far. 

For example, here's the data for my first couple of sessions:

| Date       | Completion % |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| 2021-09-10 | 15%          |
| 2021-09-13 | 24%          |
| 2021-09-14 | 25%          |
| 2021-09-16 | 27%          |
| 2021-09-18 | 27%          |
| 2021-09-22 | 33%          |
| 2021-09-26 | 46%          |

Now, what if I could create a prognosis based on that data. 

I first calculated how far I came per day in each session: 

| Date       | Completion % | Days | Gain in % | Gain in % per day |
| ---------- | ------------ | ---- | --------- | ----------------- |
| 2021-09-10 | 15%          |      |           |                   |
| 2021-09-13 | 24%          | 4    | 9%        | 2.25%             |
| 2021-09-14 | 25%          | 2    | 1%        | 0.50%             |
| 2021-09-16 | 27%          | 3    | 2%        | 0.67%             |
| 2021-09-18 | 27%          | 3    | 0%        | 0.00%             |
| 2021-09-22 | 33%          | 5    | 6%        | 1.20%             |
| 2021-09-26 | 46%          | 5    | 13%       | 2.60%             |

It was some simple Google Sheet calculations, required, to calculate those 3 columns:

```text
Days
=IF(A3<>"",Days(A3,A2)+1, "")

Gain in %
=IF(A3<>"", B3-B2, "")

Gain in % per day
=IF(A3<>"",D3/C3,"")
```

Perfect - now let's create some prognosis. 

Each day I progress a few %. Some sessions it's more and others less. Sometimes I don't get time to work on this for quite some time and others it's a few days after each other. 

I'm gonna use `PERCENTILE` for that and call the lowest 25% my worst case, 50% my probable, and the top 75% my best-case scenario. 

| Projection - Bottom 25% gain / day (G) | Projection - Median gain / day (H) | Projection - Best 75% / day (I) |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 0.54%                                  | 0.93%                              | 1.99%                           |

The formula uses the `Gain in % per day` column like this

```text
Worst case
=PERCENTILE($E$2:$E, 0.25)

Probable
=PERCENTILE($E$2:$E, 0.5)

Best case
=PERCENTILE($E$2:$E, 0.75)
```

I then create a long list of dates, going from the first time I worked on the project and 6 months into the future. For each date I added four columns like below, and incremented the 3 first with the values I calculated with the percentiles above:

| Date (L)   | Worst case (M) | Probable (N) | Best case (O) | Actual (P) |
| ---------- | -------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ---------- |
| 2021-09-10 | 15.0%          | 15.0%        | 15.0%         | 15.0%      |
| 2021-09-11 | 15.5%          | 15.9%        | 17.0%         | 15.0%      |
| 2021-09-12 | 16.1%          | 16.9%        | 19.0%         | 15.0%      |

(I also started at 15% as I didn't have any data before that)

That means that the second rows formula looks like this:

```â€ ext

=IF(M2+$G$2>1,1,M2+$G$2)
```

Take the value from the G2-cell and add it to the value of the row above: `15% + 0.54% = 15.54%`. For the probable and best scenarios, I did the same thing but using those percentiles. 

The final column is the actual value, where I used my original data, which I based the prognosis on. It shows what *actually* happened and makes a nice little addition to the prognosis to see where we are today. 



But I don't have all the dates in that list so I will use the latest value I have until a new is discovered:

```text
=IF(COUNTIF($A$2:$A, L3) > 0, VLOOKUP(L3, $A$2:$B, 2, TRUE), P2)
```

Where:

* `$A$2:$A` contains the dates where I made some work
* `$A$2:$A` contains the percent of completion when I made some work
* `L3` contains the date for this row

After filling out all the days six months worth of data was easy and I could then create the following graph:

![Projections](/img/DNFSProjections.png)

## Summary and future

The projections are based on the data that I have created so far and hence this graph will be updated as we go. This is exactly what I wanted because it reflects what has happened. Just like a good weather prognosis, we update it as we get more data. 

For example, let's say that I get two days worth of working this week (at the time of writing) and I get a few percent done each day:

| Date       | Completion % | Days | Gain in % | Gain in % per day |
| ---------- | ------------ | ---- | --------- | ----------------- |
| 2021-10-14 | 48%          | 19   | 2%        | 0.11%             |
| 2021-10-15 | 49%          | 2    | 1%        | 0.50%             |

That will make both the actual line and the projections change into this...

And I'm in trouble, but I can explain that I need more time. And I will have a nice way to communicate with my colleagues about how things are going and *when I will be done*
