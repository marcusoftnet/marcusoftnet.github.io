If you ever
are in Russia... in St <span>="blsp-spelling-error"><span>="blsp-spelling-error">Petersburg</span></span>... please take the
bus. This is one of the crossings in the town.

No lights. No stop-signs. No <span>="blsp-spelling-corrected">speed limit</span>. Looks pretty
dangerous. Or like <span>="blsp-spelling-error"><span>="blsp-spelling-error">Borat</span></span> says: to drive like that
".. is like giving gun to monkey. Very Dangerous! "
