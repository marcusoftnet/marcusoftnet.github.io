I added this line in a
<a href="https://github.com/marcusoftnet/Kwitansi/blob/master/README"
target="_blank">README file</a> for one application I'm writing now.
Like I have done before many times. However, for the longest time I have
written my tests first, maybe not
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development"
target="_blank">TDD</a> or even unit tests, but I write the test first.
Most of the times.

But not this time. Because I was in a hurry and I didn't think that this
application would be something we'd use.

And of course we ended up using it. And creates a financial record and
prints a receipt. It's kinda of important that it's correct.

It just struck me:

- how much harder it is to write the tests afterwards
- how much I change in my production code, that wasn't in place, when
    I go through it and test it
- how much more boring it is to write the tests afterward
- how easy and tempting it is to "cheat" and not test the hard stuff
- how hard the feeling "this is not done/safe/correct/complete" hits
    me in the face
- how little satisfaction I get from completing a test. It's just like
    paying off an overdue bill. "Yes, I should have done this before.
    Now it's done".

I'm not saying that You have to write your tests first. I'm just saying
that to me it's: easier, safer, less boring, gives me better discipline
and more rewarding. You do as you want.

I will never write "TODO: Add tests..." again without remember these
feelings.
