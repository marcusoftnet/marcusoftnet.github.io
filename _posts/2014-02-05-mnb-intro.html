<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I have been playing with <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">NodeJs</a> during the evenings. Really late onto that train, by here we are. In fact, this is just by coincident; I happened to bring "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742" target="_blank">JavaScript - the good parts</a>" to <a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2013/06/moving-to-indonesia.html" target="_blank">Indonesia</a> and it was the only book I had. Once I had read that awesome book, I got invited to <a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2013/12/nancy-fx-now-you-can-read-her-too.html" target="_blank">write a review</a> for the <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/nancy-web-development/book" target="_blank">NancyFx book </a>by Christian Horsdal and got a free book for my effort. I just picked one and it happened to be <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/mastering-nodejs/book" target="_blank">Mastering Node.js.</a><br /><br />After that book and my head had stop spinning, we still had to wait for our belongings to arrive to Indonesia. I had nothing to read or code. So I thought I would put my Node-knowledge into action. And started to check out <a href="http://expressjs.com/" target="_blank">Express</a>.<br /><br />Here we are. I haven't really coded anything real, but rather read, labbed and followed a lot of tutorials. But i've picked a couple of things that I've found very useful. I really don't know how to classify them, but maybe it could be called patters, as in "ways I often end up working".<br /><br />BIG DISCLAIMER - these are just my remember list. I'm getting old. I forget stuff. I write it here. I'm getting old. I forget ... no... wait... What I'm saying is that you shouldn't expect to be blown away by the depth and innovation here. But I can almost guarantee that you and I haven't thought about the same things. You might pick something interesting up.<br /><br />This will be super long if I put everything into a single post. So I'll do many small posts instead. Here's the link list:<br /><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2014/02/mnb-terminal.html" target="_blank">Doing stuff in the terminal is not scary at all</a></li><li><a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2014/02/mnb-npm.html" target="_blank">npm is not only for getting packages</a></li><li><a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2014/02/mnb-packagejson.html" target="_blank">Package.json is a mighty tool</a></li><li><a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2014/02/mnb-git.html" target="_blank">Git is not that hard, but I need to refresh my knowledge</a></li><li><a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2014/02/mnb-callbacks.html" target="_blank">Callback function is cool stuff, and I even know how to write them</a></li><li><span style="color: #0000ee; text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2014/02/mnb-mocha.html" target="_blank">mocha is cool both as framework and test runner</a></span></li><li><a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2014/02/mnb-should.html" target="_blank">Should is a nice way to do asserts</a></li><li><a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2014/02/mnb-monk.html" target="_blank">monk is an easy way to access mongo</a></li><li><a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2014/02/mnb-express.html" target="_blank">Express is best without generators</a></li><li><a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2014/02/mnb-supertest.html" target="_blank">supertest is a nice way to test an api</a></li></ul>I'm also planning to write a "putting it all together"-post where I create a little back-end api for a small site using the "patterns" I've written about.<br /><div><br />I've learned a lot from different sources, but one that I keep coming back to is the excellent writings of <a href="https://twitter.com/azat_co" target="_blank">Azat Mardanov</a> on his blog&nbsp;<a href="http://www.webapplog.com/">http://www.webapplog.com/</a>. Thank you sir!<br /><br />The&nbsp;<a href="http://tekpub.com/products/node" target="_blank">Node course at TekPub</a> is awesome too and be sure to check it out.<br /><br /></div></div>
