My new
project has just completed it's first sprint; Sprint 1 (or maybe 0 since
we have done some basic decisions regarding our technology and
environment).

Again - i am amazed how far you can get if you put your will to it. This
project was initiated with a whole day meeting that was concluded by a
comment from the customer; "you know, several people has been looking
into this and said: it can't be done. Good luck!". Cheerful fellow ;)

But here we are - good on our way to solve the problem. The team is also
surprising me getting some pretty hard stuff done on a relative short
time span. Well done everyone!

Fingers crossed for the Scrum Demo (which for our Sprint0/1 is running
on my development machine, inside Visual Studio.... Brrr).
