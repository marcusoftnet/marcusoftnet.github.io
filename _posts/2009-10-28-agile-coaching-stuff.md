I stumbled over a great resource for agile coaches,
<http://www.agilecoach.net>. Don’t let the humble, yet informative,
first page put you off – there some really great and fun stuff inside.
For example:

-   <a
    href="http://www.agilecoach.net/coach-log/starting-out-with-a-new-team/"
    target="_blank">Starting with a new Team</a>
-   <a href="http://www.agilecoach.net/coach-tools/" target="_blank">Coach
    tools</a>
-   <a href="http://www.agilecoach.net/coach-log/" target="_blank">The Coach
    log</a> – how to do agile coaching

I know I will be spending a lot of time here.
