I recently discovered an excellent resource for agile coaches: [AgileCoach.net](http://www.agilecoach.net). Although the homepage may seem modest, it contains a wealth of valuable and engaging content. Some highlights include:

- [Starting with a New Team](http://www.agilecoach.net/coach-log/starting-out-with-a-new-team/): Insights and strategies for beginning work with a new team.
- [Coach Tools](http://www.agilecoach.net/coach-tools/): Useful tools and techniques for effective agile coaching.
- [The Coach Log](http://www.agilecoach.net/coach-log/): A collection of posts on various aspects of agile coaching.

I’m looking forward to exploring these resources further—they’re sure to be a great addition to my agile coaching toolkit.
