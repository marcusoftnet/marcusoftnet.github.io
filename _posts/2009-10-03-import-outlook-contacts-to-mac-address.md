Importing your Outlook contacts to the Mac Address Book can be tricky, especially if you want to avoid losing non-text data like images or if you don't want to spend money on tools. Here's a free and easy method to get it done:

1. Open Outlook (I'm using 2007) and go to Contacts.
2. Select all the contacts, right-click, and choose "Send as Business Card." This will attach all selected contacts to an email.
3. Send the email to an account that your Mac can access.
4. On your Mac, open the email and save all attached contacts (Save -> All) to your hard drive.
5. Use Finder to navigate to the folder where you saved the contacts.
6. Drag and drop the saved contact files into the Address Book.

This method is a bit cumbersome if you have many contacts—I had 238, and sending them took some time—but it's a free solution.

For those who are sync enthusiasts, like myself, you can go to Address Book and navigate to Settings -> Accounts. Check the "Sync with Google" option to upload your contacts to the cloud.

Enjoy your hassle-free contact import!
