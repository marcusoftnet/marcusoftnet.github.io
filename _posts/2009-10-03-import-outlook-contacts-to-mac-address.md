OK – I know that a lot of stuff has been written on this. But most of
these doesn’t really cut what I want. Mainly for two reasons:

- Either you could export your contacts to CSV (comma separated text
    format). This causes loss of non-text data such as images etc.
- There are some really good (I presume?) tools for this. But they all
    cost money… Some of the cost a lot. $49 for
    <a href="http://www.contactsexporter.com/" target="_blank">Outlook
    Contacts Exporter</a>. My solution is free.

Don’t bother about that. Here is how you do it easily and absolutely
free.

1. Open Outlook (I’m using 2007) and go to Contacts.
2. Mark them all, right-click and go “Send as Business Card”. This will
    attach all the marked contacts to a mail.
3. Send the mail to a mailbox that your Mac can read.
4. Open the mail and save all contacts (Save-\>All) to the hard drive
    of the Mac
5. Use Finder to open the folder where you have stored the cards.
6. Now drag them into Address Book

It’s a bit verbose, especially if you have many contacts. I had 238 and
it took quite some time to send that mail… but hey free is free, isn’t
it.
