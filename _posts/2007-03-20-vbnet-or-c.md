In a upcoming project we'll be using VB.NET. The customer has chosen
that language as their company standard and there no use or point to
argue about that. ... Although i can't see the advantages with VB.NET
over C#.

The last time i started a discussion about this it resulted in ca 30
mails with suggestions about why C# is superior... but at the end of the
day it's only syntax. Since the compiler will translate the code into
MSIL (intermediate language) which then will be executed by the runtime
there is no performance gain using C# or VB.NET.

C# seems to be the most popular choice though - i tried a
[Google-search](http://www.google.se/search?hl=sv&q=vb.net+for+c%23+developers&meta=)
on "vb.net for c# developers" and almost all hits has to do with
converting a VB.NET developer into a C#-developer and not the
opposite.

A popular point in why to chose VB.NET is that if you come from a VB6
environment you will recognize the syntax. This wrong and dangerous, in
my opinion - here's why

-   First - VB.NET is object-oriented and as such as a very different
    style and syntax of programming. Stuff like CStr() and Len() are
    completely wrong in VB.NET for example
-   Secondly - i think that you actually can benefit from a whole new
    syntax when learning a new style (OOP) of programming. In a way you
    will be hinder to "fall of the wagon" if the expression is allowed.


Well - my standpoint in the matter seems to be clear now, i presume...
C# rules. Looking forward on trying out VB.NET though. :)

So - i have to get going and brush up on the differences in syntax and
found [this
article](http://www.4guysfromrolla.com/webtech/012702-1.shtml) that,
hopefully is to use for me.
