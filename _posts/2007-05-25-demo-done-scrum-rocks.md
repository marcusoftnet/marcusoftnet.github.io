Another
demo, another day! The demo yesterday went very well and more important
the people that attended the demo was please and the project is running
well.

I am most impressed with the output that SCRUM gives... We have been
coding for three weeks now and actually have something useful to show to
the customer. They understood that this was only a part, but a full
part, of the final product.

More so - the team members seems to enjoy themselves in the project and
we have great "flow" right now. It the project-heaven i always heard
about... i hope i don't have to experience the counterpart of it...
