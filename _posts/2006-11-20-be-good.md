Last
week I was in a terrible mood here at work. I am embarrassed even to
think about it...This has to do with me not being happy about the
situation we are in at my customer.

But I noticed one strange and weird thing: the more moody and angrier i
got, the worse the situation got (or seemed to be).

So this week I am trying a whole new approach: I will not be angry a
single time at work (and not a home either I hope :-)). A all in all
positive approach is the credo of this week. It will be a good lesson
for my self and also an experiment to see if it really works.

So to start things off, in the words of ET: "BE GOOD!" (and let's see
where **that** takes us - Marcus)
