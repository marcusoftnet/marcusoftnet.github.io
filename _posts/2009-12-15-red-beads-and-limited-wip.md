I attended the second [Limited WIP Society](http://www.limitedwipsociety.org/) (Sweden) gathering. It’s a bunch of people that have taken a liking to Kanban practices.

This evening [David J Andersson](http://www.agilemanagement.net) joined us and gave a very interesting presentation on how [Kanban](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban) teams can reach [CMMI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMMI) level 5, i.e. ranked as very mature. This is, apparently, not repeated by teams doing other agile methods.

OK – during the second half, me and [Joakim Sundén](http://www.joakimsunden.com/) presented the Red Bead Experiment. Well, "played it out" I think would be a more appropriate way to describe it. It’s a game that aims to drive home the point Dr. W. Edwards Deming made – [“a bad system will beat a good person every time”](http://matthrivnak.com/lean-quotes/).

If you haven’t seen it before, there is an [excellent recording](http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/agile-scrum/demings-red-bead-experiment) with Benjamin Mitchell and David Joyce.
