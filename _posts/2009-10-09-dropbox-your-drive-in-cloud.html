<p>I am trying to live as I teach, and I think that I, in the near future, will talk to customers about storing stuff <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing" target="_blank">“in the cloud”</a>.</p>  <p>To not be a complete hypocrite I have started to store <a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2009/09/synchronization-for-consultants-how-i.html" target="_blank">more</a> and <a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2009/09/add-coolness-to-your-presentations.html" target="_blank">more</a> stuff in the cloud.</p>  <p>After email, contacts and calendar it’s now time for my files. <a href="http://www.getdropbox.com" target="_blank">DropBox</a> is a really nice alternative. It also have the possibility to share certain folders with others, or go public altogether (here is <a href="http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/2408484/Marcusoft.FluentAutomapper.zip" target="_blank">some code</a> for example). Finally it' syncs to all my computers that have <a href="http://www.getdropbox.com" target="_blank">DropBox</a> installed. </p>  <p>Nice, really nice. No more USB…</p>
