Found [this paper](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/docs/ReSharper40DefaultKeymap.pdf) with the (default) keymapping for Resharper. Here is also some demos etc.

Finally, there is an update to ReSharper to 4.1 - hopefully, it will solve my [stability problems](https://www.marcusoft.net/2008/10/resharper-crashes.html). I'll keep you posted...
