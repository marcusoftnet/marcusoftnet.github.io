This
is really fun and maybe useful also: <http://www.midomi.com>

What the site does is that it allows you to sing or hum a part of a song
and then it finds the song for you. But wait, there is more; when you
find the song you can also hear how others has ... interpret the song.

This will be so fun in a few months when there are loads and loads of
songs.
