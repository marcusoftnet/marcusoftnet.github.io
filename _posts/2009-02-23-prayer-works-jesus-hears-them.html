<p>I have this last week got two very real answers to my and other peoples prayers. </p>  <p>I am still amazed that I still become amazed that prayers are answered.</p>  <p>But that is how it is – it works. So if you ever find yourself in peril just put your hands together and whisper “Jesus – help me now!”. </p>  <p>He will hear you!</p>
