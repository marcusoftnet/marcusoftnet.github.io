OK - it's so late for this. They have probably started soon. But here is
my predictions for the Swedish Brass Band championships:

The winner is almost obvious - [Windcorp Brass
band](http://www.windcorpbrassband.se/) is the best band in Sweden now
and for a long time ahead. They play so well and have loads of
experience to go with it. They will win. Probably with a big margin as
well.

Number two should be [Stockholm Brass
Band](http://www.stockholmbrass.se/). They have the best line-up, but it
consists of mostly professionals. And rehearsing for two weeks straight
without pay is not the highest priority. Also it has been some sickness
disturbing the preparations.

[Solna Brass](http://www.solnabrass.com/) will most likely take the
third place. But they are a dark horse to nick Stockholm at the first
one. They meet every week and rehears very serious. They could do it.

So here is the probable order:

1.  First: [Windcorp Brass band](http://www.windcorpbrassband.se/)
2.  Second: [Stockholm Brass Band](http://www.stockholmbrass.se/)
3.  Third: [Solna Brass](http://www.solnabrass.com/)
