Today is the first "real" day of the year here in Sweden. A lot of
public holidays and weekends is to an end and to be frankly it's quite
nice. Now it is back to normal with all people in the office and no more
half
days.

I good old Marcus-style the first week is quite hectic also with
engagements all days of the week, save Friday. Most of them (all when i
think of it) will be fun and good to do.

So - I hope that you also will have a good start on the new year!
