Today is the first "real" day of the year here in Sweden. A lot of
public holidays and weekends is to an end and to be frankly it's quite
nice. Now it is back to normal with all people in the office and <span

half
days.

I good old Marcus-style the first week is quite hectic also with
engagements all days of the week, save Friday. Most of them (all when i
think of it) will be fun and good to do.

So - i hope that you also will have a good start on the new year!
