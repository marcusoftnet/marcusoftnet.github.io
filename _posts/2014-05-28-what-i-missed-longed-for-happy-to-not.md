Tomorrow I will end a 30 day social media fast.

I got a bit overwhelmed and depressed by some comments and discussions
that I was drawn into and aired it with my buddies at
<a href="http://www.aptitud.se/" target="_blank">Aptitud</a>. 2 minutes
later 3 of us decided to go on a fast.

I uninstalled all my social media apps and removed the shortcuts to the
sites. The first thing was to make it
harder to use it. I was in real deep, and even felt a bit stressed that
if I didn't read my stream the first thing in the morning.  The first
couple of days it was pretty close that I got back in a couple of times.
I realized that if I was waiting for a slow page (ALL pages when in
Indonesia) I often switched over to Twitter to catch up.... And got
stuck.

Full disclosure: I have been tweeting pictures from
the <a href="http://twitter.com/kanbanInAction"
target="_blank">@kanbanInAction</a> account just to promote the book.
And yesterday I was on facebook for my work, gathering examples of
social media in the Salvation Army.

After about 5 days I forgot all about it and since then it just been a
joy. I read a fictional book for the first time in several years. This
has not only to do with not being on social media, but it gave some
space and room.

In this post I will just list the things I have missed, not missed and
the reasons for me taking it up again...

### Missed

I missed the quick check ins or possibilities to ask people questions,
like
"Hey <a href="http://twitter.com/gblock" target="_blank">@gblock</a>,
does <a href="http://scriptcs.net/" target="_blank">ScriptCS</a>
supports dynamic yet?"

I missed the overview and flow of information that gives me a kind of
news digest on what's happening. Like what are people talking about
around agile? Have
<a href="http://www.koajs.com/" target="_blank">Koa</a> picked up yet in
the main stream community?

Mostly I've missed talking to people. How is Hugo doing? Did Emma
succeed with her plans? Have Tobbe delivered that speech he was working
with? Things like that. I missed talking with people.

### Not missed

I don't miss the stress about checking my twitter stream. I have now
decided to do that 3 times a day. 20 minutes max when I get into the
office, after lunch and when I get home. I will not install any apps to
check social media for me, but will have to go through the "hassle" of
opening a browser.

I don't miss the stress of tweeting. "oh, this would make a great
tweet". I will not tweet that anymore. My day to day life simple is not
that interesting. I think.

I don't  miss the anxiety of publishing things. "Dare I publish this?",
"Wonder what X would answer to this tweet". Those thoughts still make me
sweat actually. I will not think about that. Any hard comments will go
unregarded from now.
Haters gonna hate.

### Go back

I will go back using social media (twitter foremost, facebook sparsely).
Mostly because that's a good way to keep in touch with friends and
family on the other side of the globe.

But I will try to change my usage a bit. In the end I was mostly talking
TO people and not WITH people. It not really the same thing. I miss
talking with people.

Oh, let's not be a total hypocrite, I miss to be able to draw some more
traffic to my blog as well :). Yes, I'm vain in that way. No apologies

See you other there. Now more carefully.
