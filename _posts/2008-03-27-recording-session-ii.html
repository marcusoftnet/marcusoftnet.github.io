Yesterday evening was the last rehearsal before the second and last recording session with my band, the Vasa Band.<br /><br />We are really in a flow right now; we feel blessed and that God is with us in our efforts and the playing standard is on very high level.<br /><br />I am really looking forward to the weekend which will be great fun and a lot of hard work. The pieces we are going to record are:<br /><ul><li>I Surrender All - a cornet solo by Andreas Holmlund</li><li>Priority - a "major" piece by Anders Beijer</li><li>Swing the pearly gates - swing piece (duh!) by Andreas Holmlund</li><li>Kan Kristus r√§kna med dig - another swing piece by Andreas Holmlund</li><li>Journey into Peace - euphonium solo by William Himes</li><li>Hawthorne march - a march from the 1920's</li></ul><p>I am really proud of the band and i am sure that this will be great. </p>
