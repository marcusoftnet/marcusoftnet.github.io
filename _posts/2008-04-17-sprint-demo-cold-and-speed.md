I'm
back - yesterday was a day with speed since we had to prepare the Scrum
demo we're going to hold today. And as frosting on the cake i caught a
cold (kind of).

Well, nothing to do about that - the sprint demo today will be running
smoothly even if i am a bit
slower than usual.

The night at the shelter was quite quiet (:)) for me. I got to go to bed
at around 2345 and woke up 7 hours later without a single disturbance,
part from a soar throat. A very small contribution from me.

**\[UPDATED\]**
The demo was a success! The product owner said that she wanted to do
"the wave", which was quite a good reception, don't you think.
