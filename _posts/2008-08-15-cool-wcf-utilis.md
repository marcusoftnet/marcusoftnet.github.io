From the [last
post](http://www.marcusoft.net/2008/08/i-like-powercommands-for-visual-studio.html)
I found a new URL for [code stuff from MSDN](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/)
that I never heard about before. But this place is golden, golden I tell
you.

Here are two small nuggets that I found in my first try:

- <http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/FileTransportChannel>>
- <http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/WCFExtras>> - that contain, among
    other things, an implementation to get WSDL in a single file (that
    [Christian Weyer does
    here](http://www.marcusoft.net/2008/08/wcf-wsdl-and-differences-from-web.html))
