I have noticed that I’ve been
<a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2009/07/parental-leave-reading.html"
target="_blank">reading some reference</a> literature in the
IT-department lately. I don’t know why but it’s a great way to get to
know some of the giants that frequently is mentioned in current hot
developer topics.

So after <a
href="http://books.google.se/books?id=FyWZt5DdvFkC&amp;dq=Patterns+of+Enterprise+Architecture&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eEBsZAYx9w&amp;sig=TNqgtVMmDoTg8GVttcoC3YlNR4E&amp;hl=sv&amp;ei=KvKxSqGpKpGk4Qb_4JjEDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false"
target="_blank">Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture</a> and
<a
href="http://books.google.se/books?id=dwSfGQAACAAJ&amp;dq=Clean+Code&amp;ei=SfKxStnQM6XCywSpjpHrAg"
target="_blank">Clean Code</a> the time had come to <a
href="http://books.google.se/books?id=gFgnde_vwMAC&amp;pg=PR12&amp;dq=TDD+by+example&amp;ei=YfKxSuCrKKbAygS7s8CvAw#v=onepage&amp;q=TDD%20by%20example&amp;f=false"
target="_blank">Test-driven development: by example</a> (my good
–<a href="http://books.google.se/books" target="_blank">Google Books</a>
is almost scary).

This is was by far the funniest IT-book I ever read. I burst out
laughing from time to other and found myself giggling through the whole
thing. For example read <a
href="http://books.google.se/books?id=gFgnde_vwMAC&amp;pg=PR12&amp;dq=TDD+by+example&amp;ei=YfKxSuCrKKbAygS7s8CvAw#v=onepage&amp;q=young%20programmer&amp;f=false"
target="_blank">this paragraph</a> about the time when
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Beck" target="_blank">Kent
Beck</a> was young.

The book itself is centered around two example that take you through a
variety of disciplines in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development"
target="_blank">TDD</a>. And then mr Beck talks about patterns in TDD;
design patterns, testing patterns and refactoring pattern.

Overall I felt that the book was more about the mindset that you should
have towards and with TDD, than to “teach” the steps. Although the steps
were thought along the way.

I almost read the whole thing from start to finnish in on go. Thank you
mr Beck for a great experience and a great book.

Oh yeah – now I have <a
href="http://books.google.se/books?id=7dlaMs0SECsC&amp;dq=domain+driven+design+evans&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bn&amp;hl=sv&amp;ei=TPSxSur8FtzKjAeql6XVCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false"
target="_blank">Domain-driven design: tackling complexity in the heart
of software</a> on the table next to my bed. I am longing to read that
one to. Reference work \#4…
