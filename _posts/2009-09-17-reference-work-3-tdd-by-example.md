Recently, I've been diving into some foundational literature in the IT field. It's a great way to get acquainted with influential figures and ideas that frequently come up in current developer discussions.

After tackling *[Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture](http://books.google.se/books?id=FyWZt5DdvFkC&dq=Patterns+of+Enterprise+Architecture&printsec=frontcover&source=bl&ots=eEBsZAYx9w&sig=TNqgtVMmDoTg8GVttcoC3YlNR4E&hl=sv&ei=KvKxSqGpKpGk4Qb_4JjEDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3#v=onepage&q=&f=false)* and *[Clean Code](http://books.google.se/books?id=dwSfGQAACAAJ&dq=Clean+Code&ei=SfKxStnQM6XCywSpjpHrAg)*, I moved on to *[Test-Driven Development: By Example](http://books.google.se/books?id=gFgnde_vwMAC&pg=PR12&dq=TDD+by+example&ei=YfKxSuCrKKbAygS7s8CvAw#v=onepage&q=TDD%20by%20example&f=false)*.

This book was by far the most enjoyable IT book I’ve read. I found myself laughing out loud and thoroughly engaged throughout. For instance, check out [this paragraph](http://books.google.se/books?id=gFgnde_vwMAC&pg=PR12&dq=TDD+by+example&ei=YfKxSuCrKKbAygS7s8CvAw#v=onepage&q=young%20programmer&f=false) about Kent Beck's early days.

The book uses two main examples to explore various TDD disciplines. Kent Beck discusses patterns in TDD, including design patterns, testing patterns, and refactoring patterns.

Overall, the book focuses more on the mindset necessary for effective TDD rather than just the procedural steps, though those are covered as well.

I nearly finished the book in one sitting. Thank you, Mr. Beck, for such a wonderful read.

Now, I'm looking forward to diving into *[Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software](http://books.google.se/books?id=7dlaMs0SECsC&dq=domain+driven+design+evans&printsec=frontcover&source=bn&hl=sv&ei=TPSxSur8FtzKjAeql6XVCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4#v=onepage&q=&f=false)*, which is next on my reading list. Reference Work 4 awaits...
