I have been looking into how to solve a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control"
target="_blank">Source Control</a> problem. The problem is that is quite
a lot of work to get it up and running in a very short time span.

OK – got an excellent tip (thanks Magnus!) on the
<a href="http://unfuddle.com/" target="_blank">Unfuddle</a>-hosting
service, that not only hosts your source control but also have lot of
<a href="http://unfuddle.com/about/tour/" target="_blank">other
services</a>, such as a dashboard, bug tracking, calendar etc. And for
very small
<a href="http://unfuddle.com/about/tour/plans" target="_blank">teams its
free</a>! And for small team, nearly free; $9/month!

That’s all good – but I need a seamless and slick integration into
Visual Studio 2008 to go with my repository. Enter
<a href="http://ankhsvn.open.collab.net/" target="_blank">AnkhSVN</a>
(wasn’t that the name
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)"
target="_blank">Prince</a> used for himself for a while?). OK – I’m <a
href="http://ankhsvn.open.collab.net/servlets/ProjectProcess?pageID=PpvZJl"
target="_blank">using the tool</a> not saying it out loud… I hope. It
looks very promising and is used widely.

With this I got an fully fledge, well-integrated and free source control
repository (and more …).

Free is nice, isn’t it!
