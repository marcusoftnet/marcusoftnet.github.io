I was recently searching for a solution to a [Source Control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control) problem—specifically, setting up a system quickly and efficiently.

Thanks to a tip from Magnus, I discovered [Unfuddle](http://unfuddle.com/), a hosting service that not only provides source control but also offers additional features like dashboards, bug tracking, and calendars. The best part? For very small teams, it's free! For slightly larger teams, it’s nearly free at $9/month.

While Unfuddle covers a lot of bases, I needed a seamless integration with Visual Studio 2008. Enter [AnkhSVN](http://ankhsvn.open.collab.net/), a Subversion client for Visual Studio. (I promise I’m not saying that out loud... I hope.) It’s a widely-used tool with a good reputation.

With Unfuddle and AnkhSVN, I now have a fully-fledged, well-integrated source control repository at no cost.

Free solutions are always a win, aren’t they?
