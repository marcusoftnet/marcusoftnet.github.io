We're
planning on using WCF for the next project and i have been scavenging
the Internet for good introductions to WCF and to message based calls.

Here what i have found so far:


A good highlevel article from MSDN -
<http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa480190.aspx>

Some great and simply screen cast on how to use Visual Studio 2008 and
WCF by Darryl Burling:

-   [Screen cast \# 2](http://burling.co.nz/MS/VS2008WCF.html) (can't
    find \#1??)
-   [Screen cast \# 3](http://burling.co.nz/MS/VS2008WCFWF.html)
-   [Screen cast \# 4](http://burling.co.nz/MS/VS2008CAS.html)

[The difference between Messaging and
RPC](http://www2.sys-con.com/itsg/virtualcd/WebServices/archives/0304/melgar/index.html)

I'll hunt some more and put the links up here.
