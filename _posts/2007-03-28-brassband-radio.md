Every monday morning I start the day by listen in to [Listen to the
band](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/aod/networks/radio2/aod.shtml?radio2/listenband)
which is a long running radioshow in UK, playing brass band music. It is
a great oppurtunity to hear the best band in a more or less live
situation.

Now, I found out, there is a contender... [World Of
Brass](http://www.worldofbrass.com/wobradio/index2.php) also has its
radio. It seems to be playing CD's (that you can buy from World Of
Brass, can you imagine? ;)) but there is some very good music to hear.
