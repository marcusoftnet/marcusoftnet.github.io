Today was a proud day for me as i for the first time ever was
published. I have written the commentaries for <span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-error">Gothenburg
Brass Bands last CD, [In Perfect
Peace](http://marcushammarberg.blogspot.com/2007/10/in-perfect-peace.html).
And now it has been
[released](http://www.worldofbrass.eu/acatalog/24884.html).

I feel so proud to be associated with that great band and such great
musicians. It sound terrific and i shed a tear or two
on certain places, when i thought about what Bengt would have said.

Thank you
