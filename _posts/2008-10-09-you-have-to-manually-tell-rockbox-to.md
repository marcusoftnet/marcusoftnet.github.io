I have just updated the operating system for my IRiver to the latest (3.0) version of [RockBox](http://www.rockbox.org/).

One big gotcha jumped up and bit me; you have to manually change a setting that enables RockBox to charge via USB... [Here is how its done](http://download.rockbox.org/manual/rockbox-h300/rockbox-buildch7.html#x10-1180007.6.2).

Really annoying for me since a H320 IRiver only charges through the USB-port... Well now it's fixed.
