My favorite radio show - the [Listen to the
Band](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/aod/networks/radio2/aod.shtml?radio2/listenband) -
show from the BBC Radio 2 has done a retrospective show of the
European.

A great part of the show is spent with focus on the Goteborg Brass Band.
Some great playing and a very nice (and clarifying interview with Clare
Farr). Thank you!

I am so proud to have been a part of that band and that great history
that now is finished.

And finally; again thank you Bengt!
