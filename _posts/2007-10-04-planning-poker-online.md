Estimations can be quite tricky to do and even trickier to get from an
developer. One way to go around that is to play [planning
poker](http://www.crisp.se/planningpoker). Follow that link for some
great explanations by the SCRUM-guru
Henrik Kniberg.

And as the Internet is a fantastic thing someone of course as made an
online version, that can be found here <http://www.planningpoker.com/>

I think that it's more important to get together than to do the actual

playing, but if you don't have that option this will have to do.
