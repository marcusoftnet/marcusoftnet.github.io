This weekend is the first and maybe the greatest competition in the
brass band year. It's the prestigious British Open.

My money is on Black Dyke who i think are playing marvelous at the
moment, better than in many years. Also i like that they not cling to
the brass band idiom but instead is going to a more modern and symphonic
sound and approach.

If they win it will be the third time in a row for them. That feat has
not been done in a lot of years, so that will be exciting in itself. I
can just imagine how tagged they are...

Also there will be some great music, a brand new piece of Kenneth
Downie. He is a great guy and a great composer writing lots of high
quality music for every size and quality of band. We are right now
playing a lot of his music and he has written some great test pieces
that test the very best of bands.

Really looking forward to hearing this piece and see who will take the
honors from the weekend. Here are my votes:

1. Black Dyke Band
2. Grimethorpe
3. Desford
