I am on my way home after presenting at two concerts with
<a href="http://www.windcorpbrassband.se/" target="_blank">Windcorp
Brass Band</a>. Exhausted but very happy.

It all went down quite well. The band was in excellent form and played
well throughout the evening and their rendition of The Cossack will stay
in my mind forever. Also the thing surrounding the concert was, as
always, good.

My own part in the whole thing went well, even though I had missed the
fact that the concert didn’t had a intermission. Quite embarrassing when
I told the audience that a break was coming up, just to then call them
back in their seats. Well, well – it became a joke and was quickly
forgotten.

I love doing this! If there was a way to make a living presenting
concerts I would take it immediately.

Thank you WindCorp Brass Band,

<a href="http://www.swedbank.se" target="_blank">Swedbank</a> and all my
friends in Gothenburg for an excellent day.
