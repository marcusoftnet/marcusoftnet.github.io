I am on my way home after presenting at two concerts with [Windcorp Brass Band](http://www.windcorpbrassband.se/). Exhausted but very happy.

It all went down quite well. The band was in excellent form and played well throughout the evening and their rendition of The Cossack will stay in my mind forever. Also, the things surrounding the concert were, as always, good.

My own part in the whole thing went well, even though I had missed the fact that the concert didn’t have an intermission. Quite embarrassing when I told the audience that a break was coming up, just to then call them back to their seats. Well, well – it became a joke and was quickly forgotten.

I love doing this! If there was a way to make a living presenting concerts I would take it immediately.

Thank you Windcorp Brass Band, [Alex](http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Hanson), [Swedbank](http://www.swedbank.se), and all my friends in Gothenburg for an excellent day.
