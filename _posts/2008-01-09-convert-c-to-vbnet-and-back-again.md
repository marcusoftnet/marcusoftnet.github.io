Found this cool online (!) tool for converting C# code into
VB.NET-dito and back again:

<http://labs.developerfusion.co.uk/convert/csharp-to-vb.aspx>

I am trying it out now and it seems to work like a charm.

OK - i've now (20 minutes later) converted about 10 files of various
size. Most stuff went well but it must be pointed out that this size
only converts code, not complete projects. This is done very well
indeed.

But sometimes I presume that you will need to convert a complete
project, settings and all and then this tool migh be too cumbersome to
use. But it worked very well for me.
