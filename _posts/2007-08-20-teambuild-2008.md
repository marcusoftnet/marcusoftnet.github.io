Whooa - in the next version of Visual
Studio (2008) they have put in a lot of work into the build engine. And
if we are honest the version that exists today is not
excellent...

But [these
introductions](http://blogs.msdn.com/buckh/archive/2007/08/14/tfs-2008-a-basic-guide-to-team-build-2008.aspx)
promise a lot, and a lot of good, good stuff too. I can't wait to read
and see more about this.
