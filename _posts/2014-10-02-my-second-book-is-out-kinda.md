To many of my colleagues and friends, writing a book is at the top of the dream list or life goals. I have been very fortunate to have done that, but quite honestly I never even dreamt that I would do it. Or that someone thought that what I had to say was interesting enough to read it. Maybe I should have realized that after 500,000 views on this blog but still...

Okay, something really strange has now happened. I have been published again. The book is called [Architect book](http://www.thearchitectbook.com/), which is even more strange, since I don't consider myself an architect. At least not on the levels that this book is about.

I was invited to write a chapter about [Specification By Example](http://www.specificationbyexample.com/) about a year ago. That was a very busy time of my life since I was finishing up [Kanban In Action](http://bit.ly/theKanbanBook), or at least going through the gruesome and long review process. Also, we were in the middle of moving out of our apartment and here to Indonesia. I had a job that was running out and that I tried to extend month by month as our visas were delayed. It was busy times.

I wrote the chapter a little bit in the same style as we used in Kanban In Action, with a short story about a project failing, to start things off and made a short treatment of each of the main points of Specification by Example. I then wrapped the chapter off by telling the story again. Now the project succeeds... and they are using Specification by Example :)

Still, I don't know why I said yes in hindsight, I accepted. And wrote my 8 pages in about 6 hours. I have since then spent maybe 6 more hours editing it. All thanks to the amazing work of the [editors](http://www.thearchitectbook.com/authors/). Especially [Daniel Akenine](http://www.twitter.com/dakenine) that held the project together in a great way.

The book takes up a lot of different perspectives and views on architecture in the "IT" business. From business architecture all the way to infrastructure and the little corner I wrote about; Software architecture. A mammoth undertaking that I'm proud to be part of. Some of the chapters are about areas that I didn't know existed, so it will be an interesting read for me too. The people involved are very well-known and great gals (and guys) all around.

The book, that looks great and very serious, is so far only in Swedish. But Swedish is not that hard. I picked it up when I was under 5 years old :)

I'm proud to have been part of this project, in a small small way. Thank you for asking me and letting me.
