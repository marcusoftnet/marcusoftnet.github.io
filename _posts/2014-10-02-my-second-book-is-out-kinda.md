To many of my colleagues and friends writing a book is at the top of the
dream list or life goals. I have been very fortunate to have done that,
but quite honestly I never even dreamt that I would do it. Or that
someone thought that what I had to say was interesting enough to read
it.
Maybe should have realised that after 500.000 views on this blog but
still...

Ok, something really strange have now happened. I have been published
again. The book is
called <a href="http://www.thearchitectbook.com/" target="_blank">Architect
book</a> which is even more strange, since I don't consider myself an
architect. At least not on the levels that this book is about.

I was invited to write a chapter about
<a href="http://www.specificationbyexample.com/"
target="_blank">Specification By Example</a> about a years ago. That was
very busy time of my life since I was finishing up
<a href="http://bit.ly/theKanbanBook" target="_blank">Kanban In
Action</a>, or at least going through the gruesome and long
review-process. Also we where in the middle of moving out of our
apartment and here to Indonesia. I had a job that was running out and
that I tried to extend month by month as our visas was delay. It was
busy times.

I wrote the chapter a little bit in the same style as we used in Kanban
In Action, with a short story about a project failing, to start things
off and made a short treatment of each of the main points of
Specification by example. I then wrapped the chapter off by telling the
story again. Now the project succeeds... and they are using
Specification by example :)


Still, don't know why I said yes in hindsight, I accepted. And wrote my
8 pages in about 6 hours. I have since then spent maybe 6 more hours
editing it. All thanks to the amazing work of the
<a href="http://www.thearchitectbook.com/authors/"
target="_blank">editors</a>. Especially
<a href="http://www.twitter.com/dakenine" target="_blank">Daniel
Akenine</a> that hold the project together in a great way.

The book takes up a lot of different perspectives and views on
architecture in the "IT" business. From business architecture all the
way to infrastructure and the little corner I wrote about; Software
architecture. A mammoth undertaking that I'm proud to be part of.
Some of the chapters is about areas that I didn't know existed, so it
will be a interesting read for me too. The people involved are very
well-known and great gals (and guys). all arounds

The book, that looks great and very serious, is so far only in Swedish.
But Swedish is not that hard. I picked it up when I was under 5 years
old :)  

I'm proud to have been part of this project, in a small small way. Thank
you for asking me and letting me.
