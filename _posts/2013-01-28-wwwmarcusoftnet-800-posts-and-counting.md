<div>

I've just published my <a
href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2013/01/pickles-generate-specflow-documentation.html"
target="_blank">800th post</a>!

Can't really understand that. I know that <a
href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2006/10/eating-my-mobile-and-nanbread.html"
target="_blank">some of them</a> haven't been
<a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2006/10/i-like.html"
target="_blank">all that great</a> but there's some nuggets of
information in there. At least for me.

That's how I
<a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2006/10/marcus-on-net.html"
target="_blank">started to blog</a>: to make myself write stuff down to
remember and formalize my knowledge.

800 posts, six years, 163 000 pageviews. That's not a lot for many blogs
out there but it means a lot to me.

Thank you for reading my blog. Even though I started to write it for
myself - comments and reactions is  what kept me going on for 6 years! I
cannot promise 6 more but right now I'm on a roll.
