Played a concert last night....

The sound of applause is so nice. The term rewarding has never been more
appropriate.

And yet the act in itself is very basic, almost childish. I wonder when
that was invented. Or if it's still different from different parts of
the world. I've heard that deaf people don't clap their hands
but wiggle them instead, that might be used in other parts of the world
also.

I recorded the concert on my IRiver (love it) and today I
will try to get hold of a program that splits Mp3's.
