I spent the weekend in the archipelago of Gothenburg. It was great! Brilliant sunshine for one and a half day and then ... games inside for the rest of the weekend.

I am a bit worried though, after the gaming session, that my relatives might not like me as much. I didn't swept the floor with them but i won the prematch-battering (you know, i talked the most about my own abilities etc.) :)

Also we had a small scissors adventure as the before, during and after series shows above... I'll add some more pictures later in the week.

This week by the way is my last at one customer and i have to prepare some big talk at my next...

Hectic week, now where have i heard that before
