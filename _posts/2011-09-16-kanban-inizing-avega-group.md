I have recently returned from parental leave and got to experience
office tempo first-hand. Was not prepared for that, but it also had me
look around and I saw two teams at [Avega
Group](http://www.avegagroup.se) that was under a lot of stress (they
said) and seemed to handle a lot of task simultaneously.

Being dunked deeply in the Kanban-pool it made the hair on my neck stand
up and I shivered to my bones. [WIP is bad you
know](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_in_process)…

Being a [Avega
Coach](http://www.avegagroup.se/sv/Elevate/Vara-Coacher/Coacher1/) I
have some time to spend at the office, so I teamed up with
[Morgan](http://twitter.com/#!/morgsterious), a fellow Lean/Agile coach
here at Avega Group – and we decided to see if we could do anything
about it.

In doing so we had to sharpen our arguments and think a bit different.
They are not creating systems you know. Both Morgan and I have
experiences mostly with software development teams, of course. So we saw
a great learning opportunity.

This has just started but I thought I’ll try to blog about the
experience here.



#### The teams and some background

The teams we approached were the Support team and the Marketing team.
The support team is a small team (3 persons) that handles a lot of the
short term activities that makes and office work. But they are also
involved in some bigger projects such as an upcoming conference for the
whole Avega Group (350 people), and getting activities there to work.
Typical task is managing travel arrangements, answering phone and the
door, booking events for [Elevate](http://www.avegagroup.se/Elevate) and
even refurnishing the office.

The marketing group is also small team with 3 persons. Their work is
made up of a lot of short marketing project combined with some long term
stuff, such as the annual report. They have a higher degree of
specialization within the group and the work is creative in character.
Typical task range from creating presentations, layouting invitations
and programs for Elevate events, creating a visual presence at
conferences such as [OreDev](http://www.oredev.org). Through all their
work the Avega Group brand is the most important thing.

Both team deliver with great quality and is very (!) accessible for
anyone who need them.

#### Humble approach

First and foremost we needed to check with them if they also saw that
they have problem. I had picked up some indices that they were under a
lot of stress and I knew that they (both teams) handled LOADS of
simultaneous work. Up to 30 small and large projects are some time in
progress. I saw them listing it on the whiteboard, then items are
delegate and then removed it from the whiteboard.

Secondly – we don’t know much about the work they’re doing. So we need
to communicate to them that we don’t want to change what they do –
merely the order and when.

So – we simply went up to the team leaders and asked them if they could
spare us a minute or five. In character they both answered Yes! and more
or less promptly left what they were doing and followed us.

When we asked if we could help – they both were very happy. Arm-waving
took place in one instance <img

alt="Smile" />.

So we set a date for a workshop – “Monday would be great. All the MD’s
are away then – which means that we get a quieter day”. Hmmm – maybe
something to talk about?

#### The goal

Our goal for them was not to increase throughput – they are already
answering up to the demands from the organization both in throughput and
quality. Amazingly and probably not indefinitely since the stress level
will take it’s toll on quality at least.

Instead we focus on a steady pace and a more acceptable stress level.
And a way to handle the interruptions that will and probably should
occur in their normal work.

#### A practical exercise – learn to count

We kicked off the workshop with a practical exercise that we hope would
give them understanding in that the more projects I focus on at the same
time the longer all of them takes.

So we asked them to write down three columns (representing 3 projects
they work on) with roman number I – X, A – J and 1 –10. To show how
context switching has a bad result on performance we asked them to write
each column with a different pen.

The first time around we asked them to write line by line, changing pen
and focus constantly. Here is my own result.

The second time (you guess it) we asked them to write column by column
finishing the first project before moving on to the next. Here is my
result doing that:

###### Findings

This game was real eye-opener for the group (although one pair did the
exercises in the reversed order <img
src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-S8rl3FrhKp8/TnI_yGgN4QI/AAAAAAAABDg/uiqiIij9K1k/wlEmoticon-smile%25255B2%25255D.png?imgmax=800"
class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile"
style="border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none"
alt="Smile" />).

-   The first time the complete exercise took (with my numbers) roughly
    2.5 time longer time (1.12 versus 0.28)
-   The first column – the most important project – was delivered after
    001.10 minutes the first time around and in 8 seconds (!!) the
    second
-   The quality suffered in many cases (writing the wrong letters,
    writing uglier and forgetting rows) in the first exercise – while
    the second time around almost no-one messed up (I did – if you look
    closely <img
    src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-S8rl3FrhKp8/TnI_yGgN4QI/AAAAAAAABDg/uiqiIij9K1k/wlEmoticon-smile%25255B2%25255D.png?imgmax=800"
    class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile"
    style="border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none"
    alt="Smile" />)
-   The general feeling was “calmer and more focused” for the second
    iteration.

Morgan and I was very happy with the outcome that we thought created an
awareness of the problems with the “old way” of doing things.

#### Lean and Kanban basics

From there it was quite easy to drive the main points of Kanban ([Visual
workflow, Limit Work-in-process and Help work to
flow](http://www.kanban101.com)) and Morgan did a great presentation of
it. But we were careful not to mention to much keywords and concepts
focusing instead on the task at hand for them and how they could handle
different situations.

#### End of part I

This blog post is getting too long already. I have posted the second
part for Monday 0900. So you’ll have to wait until then to get the rest
of our work.
