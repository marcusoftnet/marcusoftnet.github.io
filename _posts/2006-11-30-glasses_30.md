I ordered my glasses yesterday. They look something like the ones on the
left. So [you
understand](http://marcushammarberg.blogspot.com/2006/11/glasses.html)
that I avoided the china man-look and went for the German terrorist
instead.

Man - those things are expensive! My only hope now is that:

1. They will make a difference. Headaches almost every other day now...
2. I won't drop them
3. I won't be so scared of dropping them that I need a string around my
   neck to keep track of them
