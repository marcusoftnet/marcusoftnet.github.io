Although some time has passed since the vacation, I realized that I haven't posted photos from it. Here is a short summary of what we did and where we went during those lovely summer months. Not too far away...

*Albert enjoying himself on the seashore - he stayed here most days...*

*Here we are on our way into the water. Again.*
