<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">As most of you probably know <a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2013/06/moving-to-indonesia.html">I'm on my way to leave the country and do other type of work for a while</a>. It's been a bumpy ride and we're actually still waiting for the work permits before we can leave. Any day now...<br /><br />The last couple of weeks I've ended most of my commitments and different consultant contracts with my customers, but I don't have anything else to do... so I thought I'll make something up. Two things popped into my head:<br /><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>last year when I did some <a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2012/12/have-presentations-will-travel.html">free presentations during a period</a> between employments&nbsp;</li><li>and the fact that I don't want to come back in 3 years and just continue with the same material</li></ul><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BNDM4OTY0NTAyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTcxMDQyMQ@@._V1_SY317_CR1,0,214,317_.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BNDM4OTY0NTAyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTcxMDQyMQ@@._V1_SY317_CR1,0,214,317_.jpg" width="135" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">From <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0500140/">IMDB</a></td></tr></tbody></table><div><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><br />People who read this blog knows that <a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2013/01/on-constraints.html">I love constraints</a>, and people that know me knows that I'm a Seinfeld buff. He imposed a constraint on himself after 10-15 years in the business. He retired all of his jokes and went on a tour called <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0500140/">"I'm telling you for the last time"</a>. After that he started over with a blank sheet and never told those jokes again.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>No comparison between mr Seinfeld and me but I he inspired me to try the same. So I'm giving the presentations one last time and then retire them forever. I will never reuse the slides, I will present the materials in new ways. I promise!</div><div><br /></div><div>You can join me for one or more of the presentations 25 - 29 november 2013. And as apposed from Seinfeld it's free. We'll also record it and you can catch it later. I will update the post with links later.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=36533086" name="more"></a>When you try to do something like this it's awesome to have a company like <a href="http://www.aptitud.se/">Aptitud</a>&nbsp;to back you up. The first time I posed the suggestion of doing something like this, us giving these presentations for free for example; their immediate reaction was just "YES! Awesome! Go for it!" Karma - that's what we run Aptitud on.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>The idea is that we run a one hour lecture during lunch, just like the ordinary <a href="http://aptitud.eventbrite.com/">Aptitud lunches</a>. It's doesn't cost you anything (as always) but you might pick some stuff up.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Here is the program for the week in question.<br /><br /></div><div><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="t1"><tbody><tr><td class="td1" valign="top" width="20%"><div class="p1"><b>Time</b></div></td><td class="td2" valign="top" width="20%"><div class="p1"><b>Heading</b></div></td><td class="td3" valign="top" width="60%"><div class="p1"><b>Abstract</b></div></td></tr><tr><td class="td4" valign="top"><div class="p1">Monday 25/11</div><div class="p1">11.45 – 12.30</div></td><td class="td5" valign="top"><div class="p1"><a href="http://aptitud.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank">Kanban In Action</a><br /><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/marcusoftnet/kanban-inactionshort" target="_blank">Slides</a><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufCa1VlItLA" target="_blank">Recording</a></div></td><td class="td6" valign="top"><div class="p1">This presentation introduces you to the principles of kanban and lean and how to apply them in practice.</div><div class="p1">You can start using kanban as you leave!</div></td></tr><tr><td class="td4" valign="top"><div class="p1">Tuesday 26/11</div><div class="p1">11.45 – 12.30</div></td><td class="td5" valign="top"><div class="p1"><a href="http://aptitud.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank">What is Lean?</a><br />(No slides, no recording - it was a workshop)</div></td><td class="td6" valign="top"><div class="p1">Have you heard about Lean (and agile) but don’t know what it means, or what you can do about it?<br />In this presentation you’ll get answer to all of the answers you didn’t dare to ask anywhere else.</div></td></tr><tr><td class="td4" valign="top"><div class="p1">Wednesday 27/11</div><div class="p1">11.45 – 12.30</div></td><td class="td5" valign="top"><div class="p1"><a href="http://aptitud.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank">Specification by example</a><br /><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/marcusoftnet/specification-byexample" target="_blank">Slides</a><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLdCV062lGs" target="_blank">Recording</a></div><div class="p1"><br /></div></td><td class="td6" valign="top"><div class="p1">Specification by example is the missing step for most development teams.

Our office is quite small so please use the links above to register for the events. so we know how much food we need to bring. Anders has promised to add canned laughter if any of the presentations draw zero people in the audience. So I hope for that too... :)<br /><br />This is the last time you'll hear these presentation from me.&nbsp;</div></div>
