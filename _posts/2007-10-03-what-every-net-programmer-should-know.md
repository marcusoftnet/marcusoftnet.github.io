Got a tip of a quite harsh and depressing page today:
<a
href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/WhatGreatNETDevelopersOughtToKnowMoreNETInterviewQuestions.aspx"
class="TitleLinkStyle" rel="bookmark">What Great .NET Developers Ought
To Know (More .NET Interview Questions)</a>

It's a list of thing that you should know to be great, according to
Scott Hanselman...

I am not sure - but it is well worth reading.

Apparently you can find answers to
many of the questions on this site:
