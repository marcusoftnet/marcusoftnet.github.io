Yesterday I followed a few links from the ["Go around twice if you
are happy"](https://www.marcusoft.net/2008/05/made-me-happy.html)-video
and as it turns out there are a whole community doing these kind of
"nice" punk actions.

If you want to see some similar stuff try the
[WoosterCollective](http://www.woostercollective.com/), especially the
following categories (some are quite strong, you have been warned, but
most are fun or just good):

- <http://www.woostercollective.com/activism/>
- <http://www.woostercollective.com/chalk/>
- <http://www.woostercollective.com/fun/>
- <http://www.woostercollective.com/3d/>

Also be warned - it is almost impossible to stop browsing the site...
