<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">

I'm a big proponent of trying to live with and take embrace of
uncertainty when you can. I've been saying "It's just how things are -
try to cope with it instead of fighting it". Inspired by Dan North and
his excellent talk:
<a href="https://vimeo.com/43603453" target="_blank">Embracing
Uncertainty</a>.

But lately I've been on the other side... where I was craving more
certainty. As often before I found myself screaming for things that's
been asked of me before. "Give me a status! Give me a plan!" I heard
myself begging.

I realized two things: it's hard living with uncertainty and the
smallest status (however uncertain) is better than no certainty at
all.



### No status = all statuses


As you might or might not known I'm in the process of
<a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2013/06/moving-to-indonesia.html"
target="_blank">moving to Indonesia</a>. Right now we are waiting for
the work permits and subsequently the visas to get into Indonesia. We
sent all the paper work to get those permits to the Indonesian embassy
in June and was told that it could take about 2 months to get them
back.

So we started to prepare for leaving in September; Elin quit her job, we
have 3 months period of notice on our apartment and have discontinued it
to last october, the kids are out of kindergarten (again a long period
of notice) and I have started to cut down on my assignments to be able
to get out quick.

As September closed in and we still hadn't heard a single thing from the
Indonesian embassy or the Indonesian immigration office, we started to
grew impatient and worried.

Since we didn't had **any** status all options were open. That is, it
was equally likely that we got a letter the next day stating:


-   All clear - please start moving
-   "We haven't even started to work with your matter, because you
    filled the forms out with a black pen instead of a blue." 
-   "Mr Who? We haven't even heard of you?" \[papers gone in other
    words\]

<div>

We were in a Schrödinger cat situation where both these (and every other
possibility) was equally likely. This drove people around us (and us)
mad. The most common reaction was actually that people couldn't take it
in at all. When I explained the situation, as above, a common question
back was: "Ok, but **when** are you leaving?" 

</div>

<div>



</div>

<div>

It's very demanding living in such a state and it tired our family and
the people around us. We could make no plans. We could commit to
nothing. Everything was up for grabs.

</div>

### Very slight status and what followed

<div>

Yesterday (Sunday 15 September) we got an email from our workplace (the
Salvation Army HQ) in Indonesia. It was short and didn't state that much
but the difference for us was profound:

</div>

> We still have no status for when this is complete, but you can count
> on not leaving before middle of October. 

Notice that theres' still no status, we still don't know when we're
going to leave. But (and it's a big butt... did that come out right :))
there's still facts in there that we can start to use. We're
**not** leaving in September. That means that:


-   we can start commit to work and other engagements throughout
    September and the beginning of October. 
-   we can relax on making plans for how to pack down our stuff in the
    next week. 
-   we can plan for things within this timeframe

<div>

And finally: our pulse and shoulders went down a bit, just from the fact
that they have started to look into our matter. They have our paper and
have started to process them. No risk of them not even having our
papers. 

</div>

<div>



</div>

<div>

Add to this that we now have a channel from which we can get more
frequent status reports. 

</div>

### Conclusion

<div>

This little story taught me a great deal about uncertainty, from both
sides of the coin. Living in uncertainty is hard. A small status can
make a big difference in how stressful the uncertainty is experience.
You probably don't know how much for your stakeholders.

<div>

The best you can do is to keep a tight feedback loop and be honest with
what you know now. It's probably more than you understand. It's very
seldom that we know absolutely nothing about the situation. The small
status you can give might be comforting for your stakeholder, especially
if you report your progress often and transparently.
