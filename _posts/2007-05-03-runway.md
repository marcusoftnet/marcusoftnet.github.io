When i was on Sardine we went to a nice (and expensive) jet set place at
the top of the island, called Porto Cervos. And there outside the Hotel
Cervo, that looked like one from a James Bond-movie, we found the car on
the picture above.

When looking closer we found that it had Swedish plates. So we checked
with [Bilregistret](https://www21.vv.se/fordonsfraga/) and checked who
owned it. It was mr Behernad von der Osten-Sacken!

After we had laughed for about 1o minutes to that name we found out that
not only was the name real, he is an economical doubtful person in the
[news in Sweden right
now](http://www.google.se/search?hl=sv&sa=X&oi=spell&resnum=0&ct=result&cd=1&q=Bernard+von+der+Osten-Sacken&spell=1).

So he's probably hiding away in Sardine, at Hotel Cervo. Did i mention
that the car wasn't paid in cash? Very nice car though...
