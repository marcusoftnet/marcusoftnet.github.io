I have a Dell Precision M70 (yes - its old now but it was great when I
got it, alright). Since I reinstalled the operating system I have
experienced that the operating system is shutting down my wireless
network card.

I knew that there were a setting for it somewhere - but I just couldn't
find it... Very frustrating. But here is how to do it in Vista:

Go Start -> Computer and right-click and go Manage. This will open
Computer Management. Select Devices and then Network Adapters and choose
your network card, right-click and choose properties.

Now the following dialog appears and you can un-check the box that
allows your operating system to shut-down the network-card.

Easy, wasn't itÂ  ;)
