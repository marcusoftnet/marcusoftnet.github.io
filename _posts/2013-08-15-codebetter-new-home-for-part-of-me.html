<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I started this blog about 8 years ago. It now contains 830-ish posts (this 831 I think). I have also just passed 20000 tweets:<br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">With my 20000 tweets I wanted to say a big "Thank you" to all you tweeps that I've learned from so much. And a shout-out to <a href="https://twitter.com/MikaelOstberg">@MikaelOstberg</a><br />— Marcus Hammarberg (@marcusoftnet) <a href="https://twitter.com/marcusoftnet/statuses/365403406258536448">August 8, 2013</a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script> During this time I have not drawn to much attention to myself, in my opinion, and by no means have become famous or well-known.<br /><br />But some truly awesome things has happened during the last years that it directly related to the fact that I've been exposing my ideas, thoughts and failures on the net. Most of the things that I have learned during the last years as also come from me interacting with different awesome thinkers - not seldom ONLY online (twitter and through the blog).<br /><br /><a name='more'></a><br />A few things that stand out for me are:<br /><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Got offered to write <a href="http://bit.ly/theKanbanBook" target="_blank">Kanban in Action</a> (with <a href="http://twitter.com/joakimsunden" target="_blank">@joakimsunden</a>)</li><li>Got a couple of truly amazing gigs - way over my head. And pulled them off in some cases</li><li>Have spoken at conferences (<a href="http://oredev.org/2013" target="_blank">ÖreDev</a> and <a href="http://www.jfokus.se/" target="_blank">JFokus</a> for example) and at numerous</li><li>Spoke at <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/agile-testing/cuke-envy-a-dot-net-programmers-attempt-to-catch-up" target="_blank">Skillsmatter CukeUp</a>&nbsp;</li><li>Offered to blog at <a href="http://codebetter.com/">CodeBetter.com</a>&nbsp;- next to some of the heroes I've been learning from</li></ul><div>In some of the cases above I'm still convinced that they've got the wrong person (but I wont tell them). In all of the cases above I'm convinced that it has to do with my "presence" on the net.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>I'm very humbled from all of this and looking back I truly cannot comprehend how lucky I've been.&nbsp;</div><h3 style="text-align: left;">CodeBetter</h3><div>If you look carefully on the list above you see CodeBetter in the list. Right out of the blue I got contacted with the following question:</div><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/Codebetter">@Codebetter</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/marcusoftnet">@marcusoftnet</a> Would you like to blog on <a href="http://t.co/beXoswqEXt">http://t.co/beXoswqEXt</a>?<br />— Brendan Tompkins (@btompkins) <a href="https://twitter.com/btompkins/statuses/362963570784354304">August 1, 2013</a></blockquote></div><div>This was followed up with a <a href="http://codebetter.com/brendantompkins/2013/08/02/welcome-marcus-hammarberg/" target="_blank">very kind blog post</a> that featured my tag-cloud and said that I would fit. So I jumped right in and wrote two blog posts (on<a href="http://codebetter.com/marcushammarberg/2013/08/06/mob-programming/" target="_blank"> Mob Programming</a> and <a href="http://codebetter.com/marcushammarberg/2013/08/13/some-tools-for-improved-focus-improve-teamwork-and-faster-delivery/" target="_blank">some experience from my current gig</a>) that actually was quite well received. Suuper nervous, of course, when I first published the post (47000+ readers via FeedReader.com), but the reception has been great, so far.<br /><br />I will keep this blog of course, but probably post the "smaller" and more personal posts here. I'll regard CodeBetter.com more like writing for a big newspaper and write some posts there.<br /><h3 style="text-align: left;">Advice</h3><div style="text-align: left;">I started this blog when I had lost my notepad three times in a month. I wrote for me. Stuff that I interested me. That evolved but I always wrote about stuff that engaged me. I think that makes for better writing.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">If I would give anyone advice it would be just that: share the stuff that engages you. You'll be amazed what will follow from that. Sharing truly is knowledge since you'll learn more as you share - ask any teacher. &nbsp; &nbsp;</div></div><div><br />More advices from some very <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/" target="_blank">prominent</a> <a href="http://wekeroad.com/" target="_blank">personalities</a> are featured in the awesome <a href="http://tekpub.com/products/get-involved" target="_blank">Get Involved </a>production of <a href="http://tekpub.com/" target="_blank">TekPub</a>. Watch it - it's well worth the money!</div><div><br /></div></div>
