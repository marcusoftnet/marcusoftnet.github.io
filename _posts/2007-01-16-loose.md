Yesterday i had (got?) my first ever massage. I must confess that I've
had some preconceived thoughts about people taking massage - but i was
wrong. I'll take it all back.

The massage in itself was not too pleasant, it even hurted for a while,
but afterwards the whole body (i mean the whole, the soles of my feet
for instance) felt so good. I was completely relaxed in ever limb and it
was only with the strongest will i managed to take me from the locker
rooms to the bus home.

This will most certainly be done more times - at least i hope so.
