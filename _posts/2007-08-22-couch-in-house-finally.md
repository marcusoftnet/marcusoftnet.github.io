We have just bought a new sofa to our apartment. Or rather we bought about two months ago but a long, long story including delay for six weeks and delivery of part of the sofa has delayed the installation until... today!

If you like to wait and don't wont your orders handled fast I can recommend Folkhemmet. I'll get back on the quality of their furniture. Enough said!

So here is Elin taking a well deserved rest after putting the whole thing together... I helped a little bit.
