<a href="https://github.com/marcusoftnet/SpecFlow.Assist.Dynamic" target="_blank">SpecFlow.Assist.Dynamic</a> came about from my own need when I wrote something that used <a href="https://github.com/markrendle/Simple.Data" target="_blank">Simple.Data</a>. 

I saw the power and simplicity (duh!) in Simple.Data by using dynamics. And I started to thinking on how it could be used in <a href="http://www.blogger.com/www.specflow.org" target="_blank">SpecFlow</a> to further simplify and shorten up the code in my steps.

This is the third and final post on SpecFlow.Assist.Dynamic. Again this is not the formal documentation. It can be found <a href="https://github.com/marcusoftnet/SpecFlow.Assist.Dynamic/wiki" target="_blank">here</a>. These are just my personal preferences and thoughts on how to use it. This time with `Simple.Data`. And it won’t be long.

### SpecFlow and Simple.Data

First you should check out Darren Cauthons <a href="http://darrencauthon.posterous.com/61641417"
target="_blank">post</a> on using SpecFlow and simple data together. It shows the great use of a lightweight, simple data access framework in SpecFlow.

As I said in my earlier post test data management is something that you often have to handle in your scenarios. `Simple.Data` is more than up to the job.

### SpecFlow.Assist.Dynamic and Simple.Data

So I thought I’ll take Darrens example from the post and rewrite it
using SpecFlow.Assist.Dynamic. 

Here is the feature Darren is using, updated to be a bit more readable for a non-technical person (spaces in headers):

```gherkin
1: Scenario: Submit a valid create account form
2:  Given the following accounts exist
3:      | First name | Last name | Email   |
4:      | Howard     | Roark     | h@r.com |
5:  When I submit the following Create Account form
6:      | Field      | Value   |
7:      | First name | John    |
8:      | Last name  | Galt    |
9:      | Email      | j@g.com |
10:  Then the following accounts should exist
11:      | First name | Last name | Email   |
12:      | Howard     | Roark     | h@r.com |
13:      | John       | Galt      | j@g.com |
```

SpecFlow.Assist.Dynamic will convert the `“First name”` header into `“FirstName”` as you <a href="https://github.com/marcusoftnet/SpecFlow.Assist.Dynamic/wiki/Conventions-used" target="_blank">might remember</a>. As will the statically typed SpecFlow.Assist table helpers if I remember correctly.

I first create the Simple.Data dynamic database object in the a method marked with the attribute BeforeScenario. And while I’m there I clear out the Accounts table as well:

```csharp
1: private static dynamic DB { get; set; }
2: 
3: [BeforeScenario]
4: public void Setup()
5: {
6:     DB = Database.Open();
7:     DB.Accounts.DeleteAll();
8: }
```

In the Given step I’m using the step argument transformations that comes with SpecFlow.Assist.Dynamic and get a `IList<dynamic>` from the `Table` as parameter to the step definition. This can then be sent right
on to the Simple.Data database object, like this:

```csharp
1:[Given(@"the following accounts exist")]
2: public void x(IList<dynamic> accounts)
3: {
4:     DB.Accounts.Insert(accounts);
5: }
```

Bom! Database table loaded – one line.

In the `When`-step I have faked up a controller. Here I am using SpecFlow.Assist.Dynamic to get a single instance, again with the use of
the step argument transformations; this time it will turn the Table into a `dynamic`:

```csharp
1: [When(@"I submit the following Create Account form")]
2: public void y(dynamic account)
3: {
4:     var fakeController = new FakeAccountController(DB);
5:     fakeController.Create(account);
6: }
```

The actual `FakeAccountController` looks like this:

```csharp
1: public class FakeAccountController
2: {
3:     private readonly dynamic _database;
4: 
5:     public FakeAccountController(dynamic database)
6:     {
7:         _database = database;
8:     }
9: 
10:     public void Create(dynamic account)
11:     {
12:         _database.Accounts.Insert(account);
13:     }
14: }
```

Finally the `Then`-step compares the Table from the scenario to the content of the database. For now I just compare the number of rows,
which is super lazy… but it’s ten o’clock and I’m tired… 

```csharp
1:  [Then(@"the following accounts should exist")]
2: public void z(IList<dynamic> expectedAccounts)
3: {
4:     IList<dynamic> accountsInDb = DB.Accounts.All().ToList();
5:
6:     // Assert that they are the same
7:     expectedAccounts.Count.Should().Equal(accountsInDb.Count);
8:     // ...
9: }
```

## Conclusion

So by marrying the great Simple.Data framework with my small efforts in SpecFlow.Assist.Dynamic we can now move clear-text scenario data from and to the database very easily and with just a few lines of code. 

I hope you found this helpful and the SpecFlow.Assist.Dynamic could be useful for you.
