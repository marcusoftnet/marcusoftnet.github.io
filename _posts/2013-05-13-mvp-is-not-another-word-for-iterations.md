In recent years, the [Lean Startup movement](http://theleanstartup.com/principles) has gained significant traction. It offers a compelling framework for rapidly validating startup ideas. However, like many concepts, it's often misinterpreted and misapplied. In this post, I'll share some reflections on the concept of Minimal Viable Product (MVP) and its relationship to learning.

### MVP

At the core of Lean startup methodology lies the scientific method, emphasizing experimentation and learning. The MVP, or Minimal Viable Product, serves as a vehicle for conducting these experiments. It's not merely a delivery package but a tool for validating hypotheses and gathering insights from customers.

### User Stories, MMFs, Themes, and Epics

It's essential to distinguish between MVPs and other project artifacts like user stories, epics, themes, and MMFs (Minimal Marketable Features). While these terms often overlap, they serve different purposes and represent different levels of granularity in project planning and execution.

### Why MVP Matters

The MVP mindset shifts the focus from product delivery to learning. Instead of asking when a feature will be done, teams should ask what they want to learn and what the smallest experiment is to achieve that. This approach fosters collaboration and invites creative solutions.

### Conclusion

The difference between MVP and other project artifacts lies in mindset. MVPs are about learning, not just delivering features. By embracing the MVP mindset, teams can focus on continuous learning and improvement, leading to more successful outcomes.

These are my thoughts on the topic. I welcome your comments and further discussions.
