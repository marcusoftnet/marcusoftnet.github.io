During the last days i have run into more and more of the
"How-do-I"-videos from Microsoft. They are really a great resource for
getting fast introduction on a subject from everything to <span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-error">Silverlight to
LINQ.

Here is the overview link:

Below it you'll find several different areas of interest.
Here are my highlights:

-   [Asp.NET with AJAX](http://www.asp.net/learn/ajax-videos/)
-   [Windows Forms](http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=7198818)
-   [Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)](http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=7198817)
