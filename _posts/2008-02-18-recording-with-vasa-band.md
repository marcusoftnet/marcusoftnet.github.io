Phew - the weekend has really been intense with a CD-recording as the
major happening. Also our prayer group was in charge of the Sunday
morning meeting which was a success but quite different from an ordinary
Salvation Army meeting.

The band has performed at a very high and consistent level through out
the weekend. I am so proud of the band! This is very much an amateur
band and still we manage to play very well and to record quite a lot of
material during the weekend. These pieces were recorded:

- Herren vår Gud - fanfare preludium by Andreas Holmlund
- Onward - disco upbeat song by Andreas
- Låt din Altarglöd beröra mig - meditative piece by Andreas
- O hur Saligt - short song arrangement by Hans Nordin
- Take up thy cross - another meditative piece by Erik Leidzén. Very
    hard to pull off.
- Este es el Dia - latin influenced piece by Andrew Mackereth
- Winchester Revival - a quick march by Kenneth Downie

Our bandmaster, Andreas Holmlund, did a marvellous job during the
weekend. He has such a great ear and really has the ability to get it
good enough.
One weekend done - on to go. Keep going Vasa Band - it is an honour to
belong to such a nice group.
