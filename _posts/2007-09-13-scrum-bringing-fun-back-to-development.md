OK - I'll make no fuzz about it. I am really excited about Scrum and
what it can do. But now after two complete days with <span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-error">mr</span> Scrum, Ken
<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-error">Schwaber</span>,
i am completely turned around. It was as closed to a religious wake-up
as you will ever come without God.

I can't imagine how development can be done with certainty, speed and
most of all FUN - in any other way... Also i am a bit embarrassed about
the way I've counted and tried to predict everything in advance - just
half a year ago.

The big differences are also the easiest - things like that people can
take care of <span>="blsp-spelling-corrected">them self</span>, change will always
(ALWAYS) occur.

So as long as i have a say in the question i will always conduct my
projects as Scrum projects from now on. There is really no other way if
you want quality. If i don't have a say <span>="blsp-spelling-error">i'll</span> still try to run them as Scrum
projects, just because i know it's best :)
