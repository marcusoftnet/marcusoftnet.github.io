OK - I'll make no fuzz about it. I am really excited about Scrum and
what it can do. But now after two complete days with mr Scrum, Ken
Schwaber,
i am completely turned around. It was as closed to a religious wake-up
as you will ever come without God.

I can't imagine how development can be done with certainty, speed and
most of all FUN - in any other way... Also I am a bit embarrassed about
the way I've counted and tried to predict everything in advance - just
half a year ago.

The big differences are also the easiest - things like that people can
take care of them self, change will always
(ALWAYS) occur.

So as long as I have a say in the question I will always conduct my
projects as Scrum projects from now on. There is really no other way if
you want quality. If I don't have a say i'll still try to run them as Scrum
projects, just because I know it's best :)
