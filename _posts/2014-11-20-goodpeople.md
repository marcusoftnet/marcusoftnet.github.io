<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">

W. Edwards Deming is one the big quote-machines in the management
business and one of the most often cited is this:

> A bad system will defeat a good person, every time - W. Edwards
> Deming 

It's not only sad - it's also true. Sadly. (Oh wow - that was an
recursive sentence almost :)). I believe this and I have seen it in
practice. But i have also seen the opposite. Like this:

> A good person will defeat a bad system, eventually - Marcus C.
> Hammarberg

Let me try to clarify what I mean and what I've seen to support it.



### Story 1

<div>

I consulted at a big Swedish insurance company for a couple of years. I
was part of a team rebuilding one of their key applications (in VB.NET).
Great guys and a team that I often think back of. One of the guys in the
team was the maintenance person for this application. His group
consisted of 4 people that supported ca 40 applications. 

</div>

<div>



</div>

<div>

I often visited him after the application was rewritten - a funny guy!
His team sat in a corner of the floor. Behind them they had a wall of
unstructured post-it notes. I asked what it was:

</div>

> "This? That's just the backdoors, unlocked servers and shares that we
> found to the production servers. We put it here to make our lives
> easier. If we find one we just keep quite about it and note it here,
> until they find it" 

Basically the **bad system** was hindering these **good people** from
doing their job properly. The system was there for a good reason;
security. The production environment was LOCKED down. And that's how it
supposed to be. Basta! To do their job they worked around the
system.  In fact - they told me that they estimated that more than half
of their time was spent finding ways to actually get their work done.

Good persons defeated the bad system.

### Story 2

<div>

I have only worked for governments once in my life, the Stockholm City
Concuil. All configuring of any computer was done by a third-party
company. And they were swamped with work. 

</div>

<div>



</div>

<div>

We needed to open a port to get access to development database (my
god... that was a long time ago... I hope those times never return). So
we created an issue at the third party issue system. And waited. The day
after - nothing.

</div>

<div>



</div>

<div>

Me: "have you reminded them?"

</div>

<div>

Team mate: "Yes - I sent an email even."

</div>

<div>

Me: "How about calling them?"

</div>

<div>

Team mate: "No - we cannot do that."

</div>

<div>

Me: "Why?"

</div>

<div>

Team mate: "That's how **the system** works. We register our issues and
wait."

</div>

<div>



</div>

<div>

We called them. And a very nice person helped us within 2 minutes. Not
only that - we kept contact during the reminder of the project and
called him for help. After he fixed it we created an issue for his
record. 

</div>

<div>



</div>

<div>

We worked around the **bad system** to get some **(good) work**
done. ** **

</div>

<div>

**Good persons (and me) defeated the bad system.**

</div>

### Story 3

<div>

A friend started a new job. After a couple of weeks I called her. 

</div>

<div>

Me: "What are you doing, E?"

</div>

<div>

E: "I'm writing a suggestion for a solution to give to the business so
that they can say that this is not what they want?"

</div>

<div>

Me: "You are what?!"

</div>

<div>

E: "Yeah, they don't really know what they want. But the phase we are in
now requires a solution document. They cannot write it - so I help
them."

</div>

<div>

Me: "Eeeeeh? Good for them. "

</div>

<div>



</div>

<div>

**E and her good friends** defeated the **bad system** by **working
around** it. Arguably she could have just bought them a coffee and
talked it over, but she was kind and followed the procedure. 

</div>

### Your options

<div>

I'm sure you can come up with many stories like this yourself. Where you
have worked around the systems. I have friends that have described their
entire job like "Working around the system". 

</div>

<div>



</div>

<div>

Sure all these stories are just examples and arguably they don't produce
long-lasting effects, systemic change etc. But what should these poor
people do? They are stuck. They have to do they work or we punish them.
They are stuck between a rock and a hard place. Putting it mildly. 

</div>

<div>



</div>

<div>

So what can we do? We need rules, right? Some kind of structure at
least. 

</div>

<div>



</div>

<div>

Yes - but if we are in a position to make rules and regulations you (and
I) have to consider what you want people to spend their time doing;
working or working around the system. Surely - I have had assignment
where more time have been spent working around the system than actually
working (see Story 1 above for one example). 

</div>

<div>



</div>

<div>

I really don't have answers for that non-question. So I leave you with
two quotes (one of those posts I guess) that I love:

</div>

If you got the opportunity to influence your environment (hint: YOU
CAN) - in which would you move it?
