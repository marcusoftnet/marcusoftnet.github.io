This is a topic I ~~rant~~ talk about quite a lot nowadays it seems.
I feel like a old LP with a scratch (just that analogy probably date me
pretty good I guess). But I do it because I see it missing from a lot of
agile change initiatives, big and small. And they are then doomed to
fail.

Just to be sure - I make no claim of being the inventor of this; I've
picked it up here and there and everywhere. Not even sure where any
more.

target="_blank">Kanban Method</a> I guess. For whatever I've learned I'm
eternally grateful. What I'm saying is this; if anything strike you as
good it was probably invented elsewhere. If it's bad - it's probably
me.

In this posts I wanted to quickly write down some ways of making sure
that your agile change initiative succeeds. But this is not ideas made
up in my head (MY GOD - the horrors...) but things that I've tried and
failed miserably with. Over and over. And learned a lot from.
 Here we go - in order of importance:

### \#1 Get a great "or else"-reason to change

<div>

This is where most change initiatives fail, I would think. In order to
change people you need to give them a real good reason. In the Lean
world people often talk about
a <a href="http://globalliteracy.org/content/kotters-8-step-change-model"
target="_blank">sense of urgency</a>. You can sum this up with the
following reasoning:

</div>

> What should we answer people when they ask: "Why do you want me to
> change right now?"

I've done (too many) changes without any compelling reason to change.
"We need to improve" is not enough. People quite often like the way
things work right now. If you just **tell** them to change without
giving them a real reason my experience is that they will just try to
squeeze the old ways in the new world.

I had a friend that once introduced
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(development)"
target="_blank">Scrum</a> at a client. After a couple of weeks a angry
man approached him and said:

> How am I expected to work like before now that we're going to work
> with Scrum?

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">

He was this guy:

</div>

|                                                                          |
|:------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|                                    <a
  href="http://blog.crisp.se/henrikkniberg/images/old-tool-was-better.jpg"

              data-border="0" width="320" height="239" /></a>              |

If you don't have a reason like that to change, the change journey will
be MUCH harder. And you have some warning signs long before that... you
will find yourself trying to find ways to convince people, say things
like: 'we'll do department X first - there's likely to be
less resistance there'.
Why resistance? Is it a good thing to do if you have to twist peoples
arms to get there?

Finally, and this a bit threatening and I don't like it, but I think
that you need an "or else"-reason. Like:

> We need to be able to move much faster or else our competitors will
> pass us within a year.

> If Acme Inc enters our market they will pass us within 3 months

These are good reasons for change. And when you have reason like this in
place you can trust that everybody understands and are willing(-inger)
to make a long-lasting change. It's turning the reasoning on it's
head:

> Release every week?! We can't do that now. We can't do anything about
> it either.

versus

> Release every week?! We need to do that. What should we change to get
> there?
