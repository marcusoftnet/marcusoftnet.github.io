Yesterday was a bit hard to keep the mood in top. Probably had to do
with the late night the day before...

Anyhow - my band (VasaBand) did a music service yesterday in [Hallunda
Folkets Hus](http://www.hallunda.fh.se/) and it was very well received.
Lots of people (200 persons) and a great atmosphere. I am really
impressed with all the activities that was going on at that place.

The band played fairly well i thought. I recorded it all and may be able
to put something up here for listening. Keep a lookout.
