When we started to use the Conchango template for Team Foundation Server i immediately got a few questions about how the states flow for the different work items.

So - I know that you can get a kind of State diagram for work items but don't know where to get it. Apparently it's possible to see with the project template editor but I didn't have that.

A short post in the Scrum for Team System forum later I got to know the answere. It's possible to see via Team System Web Access. Here is how you do it:

- Open Team System Web Access
- Open a work item of the type you're interested in (a sprint backlog item for example)
- In the tools-menu of the work item choose State Diagram (see picture)

Beware, though - those diagrams are not that easy to read / understand. But at least now you can see them
