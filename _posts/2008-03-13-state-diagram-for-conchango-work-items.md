When we started to use the Conchango template for Team Foundation Server
i immediately got a few questions about how the states flow for the
different work items.




So - i know that you can get a kind of State diagram for work items but
don't know where to get it. Apparently it's possible to see with the
project template editor but i didn't have that.

A short post in the Scrum for Team System forum later i got to know the
ans were. It's possible to see via Team System Web Access. Here is how
you do it:

</div>

-   Open Team System Web Access
-   Open a work item of the type you're interested in (a sprint backlog
    item for example)
-   In the tools-menu of the work item choose State Diagram (see
    picture)

Beware, though - those diagrams are not that easy to read / understand.
But at least now you can see them
