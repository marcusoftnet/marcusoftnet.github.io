This weekend was spent at my sister, Therese, in Link√∂ping. This is the
fith (or so) town in Sweden, in size but the difference from Stockholm
is very obvious when you are in the town. You can feel that different
styles from the citys just by walking around in the cities.

So in a way we made a small vaccation, to another place (not another
time though) over the weekend. Even the weather was wierd with sunshine
and hailstorms interchangning each other.
