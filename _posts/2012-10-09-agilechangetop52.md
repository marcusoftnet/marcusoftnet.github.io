This is the second post on my top 5 ways of making sure that your
agile change initiative succeeds. But this is not ideas made up in my
head (MY GOD - the horrors...) but things that I've tried and failed
miserably with. Over and over. And learned a lot from.

This is the list - in order of importance:

### \#2 Sit together

Now that I've got your attention from the last scary post... We turn to
a much much simpler thing. But it's still super-important, entering
number 2 on my top 5 change tricks.

Are you ready? Pens out? Here we go:

> Sit together!

There. You read it here first. I'm giving certifications in this method
if you want to.

Seriously this is a thing that really really makes a difference. People
that are going to work together should sit together. Yes, **even** if
you belong to different departments. Breathe... and again... deep
breaths...

Strangely enough we are social beings. Sitting together increases
the likelihood that we start talking to each other and clear out
misconceptions and how to best work together.

It's **doesn't** have to be full time. Here's a story that solved a lot
of problems for us in one team I coached:
We had a really hard time to get hold of our business analysts. They
were super busy and could just met with us each sprint demo. The rest of
the communication was done via documents and emails. Causing massive
confusion and sending of even more documents back and forth. Increasing
the confusion... You get it, right?
We solved this. You know how? I asked them if they could sit at table
next to the developers. For 1 hour a day. And just read their email.
They agreed.
All problems (well that had with communications to do at least) went
away. Lots of more communications. Less documents and emails sent back
and forth. Less misunderstandings  They **talked** to each other, since
they sat next to each other.

I can now hear someone way in the back... Yes, I can hear what you
think; "Just because they sit together doesn't mean that they **will**
talk". No - but the likelihood increases. A lot!

This sounds super-simple but at some companies where I've worked this is
hard and costly. Moving a table or workplace can cost 5000 SEK ($800).
But then move. Offically. Just sit there and work during the days.

Sit together - great things happen when people are close to each
other.
