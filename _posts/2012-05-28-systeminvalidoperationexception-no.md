We’ve run into a little issue with
<a href="http://fluent.stirno.com/blog/"
target="_blank">FluentAutomation</a> and using MsTest at my current
client. I’ve <a
href="https://www.marcusoft.net/2012/05/specflow-page-objects-and.html"
target="_blank">blogged about the setup before</a> but then I used
<a href="http://www.nunit.org/" target="_blank">NUnit</a> and everything
worked just fine. With MsTest… we had some problems. The first was an
exception that was thrown to us like above:

> System.InvalidOperationException: No automation provider available

It was a quite awhile since I’ve used MsTest and I’ve forgot about some
of it’s quirks. With the combined help of
<a href="http://hakanforss.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Håkan
Forss</a> and
<a href="http://www.hugohaggmark.com/" target="_blank">Hugo Häggmark</a>
I managed to get this to work.

Scroll to the end for the short version, by the way.

The first thing that I had forgot was that MsTest uses a Visual Studio
project template of it’s own. You cannot use the Windows Class Library
template, but rather should use the Test project (under the
Test-category).

Once that was out of the way – we hit the error message above. To solve
that we started to try to understand why. It turns out that
FluentAutomation uses some sort of dependency resolver internally (it’s
<a href="https://github.com/grumpydev/TinyIoC"
target="_blank">TinyIoC</a> btw) and after reading through the
FluentAutomation source I realized that the dependency wasn’t resolved
properly. It couldn’t find a implementation of the needed interface.

About here Håkan reminded me of that MsTest actually is copying all the
files it uses to run into a separate TestResults folder. This is a bit
strange but quite handy as you then can move that folder to a server and
run the tests there, or maybe rerun the tests exactly as it was at a
certain time of execution.

But in our case the dependency resolver didn’t find the implementation
for a needed interface. Presumably because it didn’t find the dll’s in
the folder it executed in – TestResults.

One thing that not many people know is that you can instruct MsTest
about which files it should deploy to the TestResults folder. This is
done by opening the Local.testsettings file and go the the
Deployment-tab. Here you can;

- Enable file deployment
- Tell MsTest which files and folders to deploy.

So first we did that. We told MsTest to deploy all of the files in the
<a href="http://www.nuget.org" target="_blank">NuGet</a> packages folder
to the TestResults-folder. And it worked!

But there’s a much easier way! When you install FluentAutomation via
NuGet all the needed references will have it’s CopyLocal-attribute set
to True per default. And MsTest will automatically deploy all the
CopyLocal = true files when deployment is enabled. Thanks Hugo for that
tip.

So we simply checked the Enable deployment checkbox and it worked!

####

#### Summary

Bah – that was way to long winding. Here’s the short version on how to
get MsTest to work with FluentAutomation. From scratch:

Create a new test project (select the Test project template under Test
category of project)

Install FluentAutomation via NuGet;
   Install-Package FluentAutomation.SeleniumWebDriver

Double click the Local.testsettings file and go to the Deployment-tab.

- Check the Enable Deployment checkbox
- Click Apply and Close
- Be amazed that the dialog didn’t have a OK-button…

Run the test,
<a href="http://fluent.stirno.com/docs/" target="_blank">for example
this</a>. Beware of any browser automation gotchas. <a

It should now work!

Hope this help.
