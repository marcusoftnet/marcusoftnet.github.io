<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I'm writing down some of the things I've picked up when I started to learn about&nbsp;<a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Node</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://expressjs.com/" target="_blank">Express</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mongodb.org/" target="_blank">Mongo</a>.

But rather about git, that I use when doing Node...<br /><a name='more'></a>I'm using <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> for source control. That statement is more a less a given these days. Ha - long gone are the days when this was a war. Git won and since I host my stuff on <a href="http://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> too it's even more compelling.<br /><br />I've<a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2013/08/OssAtMs.html" target="_blank"> already written about</a> my small, but to me sufficient knowledge about git, but I dare to repeat it here. I have actually got by the last 3 years with just knowing 6-7 commands and understanding some simple facts about the git architecture.<br /><br /><a href="http://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git</a> is a distributed source control system, meaning that every developer have a complete copy of the repository. You clone the repository to get a local copy, of your own. In addition Git uses a staging area in which you "compose" a commit before you commit it into the repository. This concept is vital to understand and not be confused by the git-way.<br /><br />Speaking of the git-way... there are graphical tools. I don't use them. The terminal makes me understand git much better and the visualisations are often making me confused.<br /><br />Here are all the commands I know and use:<br /><br /><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">git -?</span>&nbsp;and <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">git [command] -?</span> - shows the help. And it's actually pretty good. <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">git branch -?</span> for example</li><li><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">git clone [URL]</span>&nbsp;- creates a local copy of a repository that you can work in. Git adds a link back to the repository you cloned as a remote repository called "<span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">origin</span>". <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">git clone https://github.com/torvalds/linux.git&nbsp;</span>for example</li><li><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">git checkout [branch]</span>&nbsp;- branches are lightweight in Git and you find yourself switching between them often. This command does exactly that. If you add a "<span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">-b</span>" to the command you create a new branch. This is useful when you start working on a new feature. <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">git checkout -b 'MyNewFeature'</span>&nbsp;for example</li><li><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">git add [file]</span> and <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">git rm [file]</span>&nbsp;- are commands that add and remove files to the staging area for your commit. With these command you build up your commit into a nice shape before you commit it into the repository. <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">git add --all</span>&nbsp;adds all your changes</li><li><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">git status</span>&nbsp;- shows how your staging area looks right now. This is run often. Like a tick almost.&nbsp;</li><li><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">git commit -m '[commit message]'</span>&nbsp;- commits the changes in your staging area into your repository. Commit often. Very often. <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">git commit -m 'GetPersonFromDatabase test written'</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">git push [remote] [branch]</span> - this command pushes the committed changes in your branch to the remote. For example <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">git push origin MyNewFeature</span>&nbsp;pushes the changes committed into the <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">MyNewFeature</span> branch to the <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">origin</span>&nbsp;repository.</li><li><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">git merge [branch] [branch]</span>&nbsp;- merges the changes in one branch into the other branch. <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">git merge master MyNewFeature</span>&nbsp;merges the changes of <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">MyNewFeature</span> into <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">master</span></li></ul><br />The only thing I often need to look up is when you start locally and then want to push it to a remote, like&nbsp;<a href="http://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Often I create an empty repository at&nbsp;<a href="http://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>&nbsp;(great wizard to do that at&nbsp;<a href="http://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>) and then <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">git clone</span><span style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;that URL. But when I haven't... I'm at a loss. So for me only;</span>&nbsp;this is a workflow for to start locally and then push to&nbsp;<a href="http://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>&nbsp;(or another remote).<br /><br />First start as normal locally:<br /><br /><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">git init</span>&nbsp;- creates local git repository.&nbsp;</li><li>do some initial work, like setting up the folder structure and the package.json</li><li><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">git add --all</span>&nbsp;- adds all the file to the staging area</li><li><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">git commit -m 'Initial commit'</span>&nbsp;- commits the change set to git.&nbsp;</li></ul>And ... here I'm stumped. Because I forgot to create a repository at GitHub and then clone it. There's great help for how to fix this <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-remote" target="_blank">here</a>. And here in short form:<br /><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Create repository at&nbsp;<a href="http://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a></li><li>Get the url to the repository, for example <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">https://github.com/marcusoftnet/ TheNewProject.git</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">git remote add origin&nbsp;https://github.com/marcusoftnet/ TheNewProject.git&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;- to add a remote repository called origin to your local repository. When you first create it locally it doesn't have any remotes. Of course.</li><li><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">git push origin master</span> - to push your current master branch to the origin remote (aka&nbsp;<a href="http://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>).&nbsp;</li></ul><br />I hope you found this useful. I know that I will. This kind of knowledge is what's fall out of my head quickly if I don't use it.</div>
