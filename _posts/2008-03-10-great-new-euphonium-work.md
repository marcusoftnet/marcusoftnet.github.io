[Steven Mead](http://www.euphonium.net/) has premiered a new work for euphonium and symphony orchestra that seems to become a classic.

You can [read about it here](http://www.euphonium.net/articles/2007/hallows/hallows.html) and also download it ([1](http://www.euphonium.net/sound/Hallows1.m4a), [2](http://www.euphonium.net/sound/Hallows2.m4a) and [3](http://www.euphonium.net/sound/Hallows3.m4a) movements) and hear some contemporary euphonium playing at its best. I am humbled and will stay in my "neighborhood" (Salvation Army music, Brass Band) for quite some time. It would be great fun to try something a bit easier with symphony orchestra...

Thank you Steven - very, very good indeed.
