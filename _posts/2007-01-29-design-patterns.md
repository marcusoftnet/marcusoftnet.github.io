Last week i was introduced to a lot of design patterns, and just
realized their great potential. Especially cool now when you can find so
many example implementations on the net. Also quite often you can find
products and utilities that encapsulate the functionality, ready for you
to use.

I will try to look into a pattern each week - just to warm up. If I find
something that not is to embarrassing to admit that i didn't know I'll
post some thoughts here...

Just found this as a starter:
