The [silly
season](http://marcushammarberg.blogspot.com/2006/11/christmas-season.html)
i wrote about is taking off! This weekend we had two very contrasting
gigs with the VasaBand (Salvation Army).

First we played at a sale at the corps - one of those "could you play
something nice but not too loud please"-gigs. It was good fun though and
we had a great time in the band.

And yesterday we played in the Stockholm City Hall - close to 1500
people came. It would have been good if they all came for us ... but
this was the Salvation Army Christmas Concert and we were the
"picturesque" Salvation Army-stuff in the concert. A lot of famous
Swedish artists were there too.
However the band played exceptionally well, i thought, and we probably
raised a few eyebrows.

This week we have only two gigs - both on Sunday. And rehearsal of
course. Looking forward to both.
