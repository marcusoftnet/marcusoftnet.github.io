This week a friend of mine, Miriam Kjellgren, is featured on a radio
show in Sweden. She is responsible for the morning devotionals in P1.

She also is one of the wisest persons i know so the programs will be
well worth listening to. You can listen to them for 30 days after
broadcast
[here](http://www.sr.se/cgi-bin/P1/program/sandningsarkiv.asp?programID=1320).

The music in between is Enfield Band playing the Light of the
World. Brass, Miriam, i am so impressed ;)
