I started this blog about 8 years ago. It now contains 830-ish posts
(this 831 I think). I have also just passed 20000 tweets:

During this time I have not drawn to much attention to myself, in my
opinion, and by no means have become famous or well-known.

But some truly awesome things has happened during the last years that it
directly related to the fact that I've been exposing my ideas, thoughts
and failures on the net. Most of the things that I have learned during
the last years as also come from me interacting with different awesome
thinkers - not seldom ONLY online (twitter and through the blog).


A few things that stand out for me are:

-   Got offered to write
    <a href="http://bit.ly/theKanbanBook" target="_blank">Kanban in
    Action</a> (with <a href="http://twitter.com/joakimsunden"
    target="_blank">@joakimsunden</a>)
-   Got a couple of truly amazing gigs - way over my head. And pulled
    them off in some cases
-   Have spoken at conferences
    (<a href="http://oredev.org/2013" target="_blank">ÖreDev</a> and
    <a href="http://www.jfokus.se/" target="_blank">JFokus</a> for
    example) and at numerous
-   Spoke at <a
    href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/agile-testing/cuke-envy-a-dot-net-programmers-attempt-to-catch-up"
    target="_blank">Skillsmatter CukeUp</a> 
-   Offered to blog at [CodeBetter.com](http://codebetter.com/) - next
    to some of the heroes I've been learning from

<div>

In some of the cases above I'm still convinced that they've got the
wrong person (but I wont tell them). In all of the cases above I'm
convinced that it has to do with my "presence" on the net.

I'm very humbled from all of this and looking back I truly cannot
comprehend how lucky I've been.

### CodeBetter

<div>

If you look carefully on the list above you see CodeBetter in the list.
Right out of the blue I got contacted with the following question:

</div>

<div>

> [@Codebetter](https://twitter.com/Codebetter)
> [@marcusoftnet](https://twitter.com/marcusoftnet) Would you like to

</div>

<div>

This was followed up with a <a
href="http://codebetter.com/brendantompkins/2013/08/02/welcome-marcus-hammarberg/"
target="_blank">very kind blog post</a> that featured my tag-cloud and
said that I would fit. So I jumped right in and wrote two blog posts (on
<a
href="http://codebetter.com/marcushammarberg/2013/08/06/mob-programming/"
target="_blank">Mob Programming</a> and <a
href="http://codebetter.com/marcushammarberg/2013/08/13/some-tools-for-improved-focus-improve-teamwork-and-faster-delivery/"
target="_blank">some experience from my current gig</a>) that actually
was quite well received. Suuper nervous, of course, when I first
published the post (47000+ readers via FeedReader.com), but the
reception has been great, so far.

I will keep this blog of course, but probably post the "smaller" and
more personal posts here. I'll regard CodeBetter.com more like writing
for a big newspaper and write some posts there.

### Advice

<div style="text-align: left;">

I started this blog when I had lost my notepad three times in a month. I
wrote for me. Stuff that I interested me. That evolved but I always
wrote about stuff that engaged me. I think that makes for better
writing.

<div style="text-align: left;">

If I would give anyone advice it would be just that: share the stuff
that engages you. You'll be amazed what will follow from that. Sharing
truly is knowledge since you'll learn more as you share - ask any
teacher.
