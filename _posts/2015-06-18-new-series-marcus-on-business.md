Where I currently work there's been a problem with budgets for traveling. And another with authority. Which basically mean that the people that I'm here to try to help will not get my help; there's no money to travel there and I have no authority, which is basically a deal-breaker in Indonesia. 

What to do? Well, since [I grow bored very fast without anything to do](http://www.marcusoft.net/2015/01/i-run-on-feedback.html) I tried to find a way. 

I started a series of presentations about the topic I wanted to talk with "my clients" about, recorded them and uploaded to YouTube. I even made [extra effort to do great subtitles](http://www.marcusoft.net/2015/06/how-to-add-and-translate-captions-for-your-youtube-video-in--minutes.html), in two languages, just to increase the chance that they will understand me.  

Before anyone tells me; yes - I know that this is maybe the worst possible way of making sure that you get an important message across to someone that needs it. But it's what I can do now.

So, [again](http://www.marcusoft.net/2015/06/new-pluralsight-course-iojs-or-is-it.html), this was something bad that made me find a way to turn it into something good. I now had to record and prepare better presentations. And I can share it with you. Win-win-win in my book! Yah!

I will do a little series of posts here, where I share these presentations with you. 

Here's all the post in the series (the links will work as I post them):

* [ca 10 minutes on Mission statements](/2015/06/ca--minutes-on-mission.html) (this post)
* [ca 10 minutes on Vision statements](/2015/06/ca--minutes-on-vision-statements.html)
* [ca 15 minutes on Strategic plans](/2015/06/ca--minutes-on-strategic-plans.html)
* [ca 15 minutes on Impact mapping](/2015/06/ca--minutes-on-impact-mapping.html)
* [ca 15 minutes on kanban](/2015/06/ca--minutes-on-kanban.html)
* ca 15 minutes on root cause analysis
* ca 10 minutes on effective meetings

<a name='more'></a>

The idea is that this series of presentations should make sense going through from top to bottom or to see one by one. Here's my reasoning behind the topics and order:

1. [Mission](/2015/06/ca--minutes-on-mission.html) this is where it has to start. WHY do we exists? What is our PURPOSE? Without [knowing that](http://www.marcusoft.net/2014/10/vision-statements.html) there's no real reason going further
1. [Vision](/2015/06/ca--minutes-on-vision-statements.html) to know where we are going. The vision is a compass pointing to a better future, how it will look when we're executing the mission perfectly. 
1. Having a vision is great but having a plan, or [strategy](/2015/06/ca--minutes-on-strategic-plans.html) to get there is of course better. This is what the third presentation is about. 
1. The presentation on strategy leaves you little bit wondering where to go next, that's where [impact mapping](/2015/06/ca--minutes-on-impact-mapping.html) comes handy. This is one of the best tools I've seen on how to get real and flexible with our plans, on a strategic level
1. When it comes to executing anything [kanban](/2015/06/ca--minutes-on-kanban.html) is of course great. Not only as a razor sharp tool for keeping our focus but also as an improvement tool for any process
1. Kanban is great since it shows us our problems. But knowing what to do with them is a harder question, or why they are important to fix in the first place. [Root cause analysis]() is a great way to find the answer to both those questions
1. I hate meetings. Because most of them are bad. But they are inevitable in most companies. In the final installation of this series I give some suggestions on how to run [effective meetings]().

I hope you find them interesting and entertaining. That was my goal anyway.
