<div class="p1">

A fantastic thing has happened to me.

</div>

<div class="p1">

A couple of months ago I got the strangest mail sent to me. It was from
<a href="http://www.manning.com/" target="_blank">Manning
Publications</a> and asked me if I would be so kind as to phone a person
called Michael there. I understood it as if Manning was going to launch
a book on <a href="http://www.kanban101.com" target="_blank">Kanban</a>
and if I could come with some ideas or suggestions on the proposed
content.

</div>

<div class="p2">

 

</div>

<div class="p1">

Mike and I talked for awhile. What have I done around Kanban? Could I
please describe it in 5 minutes for a total newbie (not that Mike was
that :))? What would I see in a book on Kanban? questions like that for
about 45 minutes.

</div>

<div class="p1">

 

</div>

<div class="p1">

Then - all of a sudden - the final question (just about the time as my
twins were tearing down the door and entering the room, i might add):

</div>

> <div class="p1">
>
> <span class="Apple-tab-span">Would I be interested in writing
> that book for Manning?
>
> </div>



<div class="p2">

I was totally taken by surprise! After the mail and some of the content
of that I had some dreams but I never thought that it would actually
happen. I have never aspired to write a book, although I've often wonder
if i could do it given the chance. How do you actually do it? Just crack
your knuckles and start to write? How much time does it take?

</div>

<div class="p2">

 

</div>

<div class="p1">

All these questions and the feeling of "why, on the earth did they call
me?" was speeding through my head as I tried to end the call in a
composed manner. When the virtual Skype hook was off the line I screamed
right out, scaring wife, kids and probably some neighbors too.

</div>

<div class="p2">

 

</div>

<div class="p1">

So I'm going to write a book!

</div>

<div class="p2">

 

</div>

### Now what?

<div class="p2">

 

</div>

<div class="p1">

Two thoughts now came over me; firstly the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome"
target="_blank">impostor syndrome</a> - who am I? People who are very
knowledgeable about Kanban will read this and critique it.... Secondly -
given what I talked with Mike about if I just wrote down the things that
me and
<a href="http://www.joakimsunden.com" target="_blank">Joakim Sundén</a>
have been presenting numerous times it will be the book right there.

</div>

<div class="p2">

 

</div>

<div class="p1">

After thinking that second thought I felt that I would be able to live
with myself without at least asking Joakim if he wanted to help me write
the book. He did (!!!!).

</div>

<div class="p1">

And that also helped me with my impostor symptoms, i experienced. I
could not think of a person better rooted in the Kanban community and
with a greater knowledge to back him up. Most things I've picked up
around Kanban have either come from Joakim or been pointers from him. He
has also opened a lot of doors for me with speaking opportunities and
contacts in the Kanban world.

</div>

<div class="p2">

 

</div>

<div class="p1">

So we're going to write it together. And I'm very happy about that too.

</div>

<div class="p2">

 

</div>

### What is it about?

<div class="p1">

Since the reference work about Kanban is written already, and we didn't
feel that taking up competition with that book was a good idea, fruitful
or really needed for that matter either, our book takes a whole
different approach. We're writing a very practical book that shows a lot
of different patterns that has emerged in the Kanban community around
how to solve different situations, problems and opportunities.

</div>

<div class="p2">

 

</div>

<div class="p1">

Here's a short excerpt from the introduction:

</div>

> This book is a down-to-earth, no-frills, get-to-know-the-ropes
> introduction to Kanban based on observations (and some hearsay!) and
> learnings from two guys experience of Kanban from working with and
> coaching dozens of Kanban teams; talking and teaching at conferences,
> and actively participating in user groups and the Kanban community for
> the last couple of years.
>
> In this book you will read about basic but powerful techniques on how
> to visualize work; how the board can be constructed, tracking work and
> it's progress, visualizing queues and buffers and even nitty-gritty
> details such as colors and other decorations that help you to organize
> and track your work items.
>
> You will also pick up some practical advice on how to limit your work
> in process throughout your workflow; by setting that limit in
> different, visual ways, when to change it and how track it.

### How are you going to do it?

<div class="p2">

We're going try an open process to how to write this book by documenting
the patterns on a blog ([<span
class="s1">www.kanbaninactionbook.com](http://www.kanbaninactionbook.com/))
as we write them. We hope to get feedback and suggestions for
alterations and that new patterns emerge over time. The site will not
contain the glue of the book, the narratives that puts these patterns
into a context or the introduction text to each chapter etc.

</div>

<div class="p2">

 

</div>

<div class="p2">

The site is not public yet as we feel that we need a couple of patterns
in place and decent shape to call it a site at all. I’ll get back to you
on that…

</div>

<div class="p2">

 

</div>

<div class="p1">

I'm very much looking forward to this project and I would love to hear
your feedback on it. Now and during the time we write.
