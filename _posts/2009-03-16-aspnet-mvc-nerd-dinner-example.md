I am going through the <a
href="http://aspnetmvcbook.s3.amazonaws.com/aspnetmvc-nerdinner_v1.pdf"
target="_blank">free sample chapter</a> that I talked about
[earlier](http://www.marcusoft.net/2009/03/sprint-planner-helper-session-20.html).
It’s one thick chapter (196 pages) but it’s really good to introduce
concepts and features of the
<a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/" target="_blank">ASP.NET MVC</a>
framework.

I love it! I cannot say anything else when after a few years of WebForms
and me not understanding I am back. I actually get this – no more funky
event-firing and endless questions about which event is fired first.

On top of that the whole framework is built and works very well to be
tested and built with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development"
target="_blank">TDD</a> .

There are so many nice little features that I just cannot wait to know
as the backside of my hand… UpdateModel and ModelState just to mention a
few.

I am now halfway through and will continue to the end. I’ll get back to
you if anything more great appears.

PS.
I think this is the way we will build web applications from now on. I
know I will…
