I am going through the [free sample chapter](http://aspnetmvcbook.s3.amazonaws.com/aspnetmvc-nerdinner_v1.pdf) that I talked about [earlier](https://www.marcusoft.net/2009/03/sprint-planner-helper-session-20.html). It’s one thick chapter (196 pages) but it’s really good to introduce concepts and features of the [ASP.NET MVC](http://www.asp.net/mvc/) framework.

I love it! I cannot say anything else when after a few years of WebForms and me not understanding I am back. I actually get this – no more funky event-firing and endless questions about which event is fired first.

On top of that, the whole framework is built and works very well to be tested and built with [TDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).

There are so many nice little features that I just cannot wait to know as well as the back of my hand… `UpdateModel` and `ModelState` just to mention a few.

I am now halfway through and will continue to the end. I’ll get back to you if anything more great appears.

PS.
I think this is the way we will build web applications from now on. I know I will…
