OK -
something has happened on the net when I was on
vacation. The new site [www.facebook.com](http://www.facebook.com/) has
suddenly exploded. With people, with functions and foremost with
activity...

I just heard about before leaving but
suddenly **everyone** has a account and is writing in guestbooks and
adding photos.

There are some quite cool functionality in there but all in all I am
getting a bit annoyed by all these stay-in-touch-sites. I mean, who
really has the time to maintain a work-network on LinkedIn,
friend network on facebook and a network of old
schoolmates on whatever.com.

Well, well it's always fun to meet friends so I'll tag along
