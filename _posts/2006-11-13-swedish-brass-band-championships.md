The Swedish brass band championships took place this weekend and as i
hope it became the best brass band competition ever in Sweden.

Also to my prediction the Gothenburg Brass band went home with the first
price. I am quite proud of getting the first three band, in the right
order a month ahead of the competition. The only thing i missed was the
points. [See for
yourself](http://marcushammarberg.blogspot.com/2006/10/swedish-brass-band-championships.html)

To my opinion Gothenburg was best on the own choice program (the part i
heard) - but not with as much as i expected. Windcorp really made a very
very good effort with Tristan Encounters - which is a very hard piece
indeed.

Full results from the competition [can be found
