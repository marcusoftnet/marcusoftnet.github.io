Just happened to stumble on [this site](http://stephenwalther.com) by Stephen Walter that contains loads and loads of small utils and tips for [ASP.NET MVC](http://www.asp.net/mvc/) coding. Such as [creating an Excel document](http://stephenwalther.com/blog/archive/2008/06/16/asp-net-mvc-tip-2-create-a-custom-action-result-that-returns-microsoft-excel-documents.aspx) output from an action.

Here you got them all in a [long list](http://stephenwalther.com/blog/category/10.aspx?Show=All).
