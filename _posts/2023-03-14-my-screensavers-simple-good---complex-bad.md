I've started this little series of posts about things that I remind myself frequently enough to make into my screensaver.

For each of these items there's a story and some thoughts that pops into my head when I see it, and I wanted to share it with you.

Here are the screensavers that I'm flicking through each day.

* [Kindness is better](http://www.marcusoft.net/2023/03/my-screensavers-kindness-is-better.html)
* Complex == Bad. Simple == Good - This post
* What would Jesus do?
* (DO(SOMETHING(SMALL(USEFUL(NOW())))))

Many years ago I worked a big ~~soul crushing~~ insurance company and we actually started their first ever agile team. I thought I was the coolest cat in town. At one of the big open landscapes I passed a man, Johan, that had a poster on his cubicle. It said:

> Simple = Good
> Complex = Bad

And I just laughed out loud. I mean; Yeah, sure! Who wouldn't signed off on that?

I moved on and didn't think about it more. Until later, often and frequently. And deep.

This is another of these very simple statements that acts like a guiding star and can actually help me in everyday decisions, and even in the large.

## Complex vs complicated

Let's get a few definitions out of the way:

> Complicated - consisting of parts intricately combined
>
> * <https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/complicated>

Meaning that many small independent simple parts can make up a complicated system of things. It might not be simple, but ultimately knowable. How a car is built, or the source code for an application, for example.

> Complicated - hard to separate, analyze, or solve
>
> * <https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/complex>

Complex is also made up of inter-related things, but for complex things there's an element of things that we cannot know, unpredictable things. How humans reacts to a decison, how nature evolves over time etc.

I think the difference is best described in the [Cynefin framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_framework#Complicated):

> The complicated domain consists of the "known unknowns".
> The complex domain represents the "unknown unknowns"

## Some examples

Here is a list of some domains that I use the lesson in

### Application structure

When building applications you very often end up with several different ways of implementing things. They all work and all have merits. This is why software development is interesting, I think.

But it makes it hard to choose. And what I've found is that more often than not, the simplest possible solution that can work actually is not only good enough but also last longer. `Simple == Good. Complex == Bad`.

Microservices is an example of where this thinking leads to a good spot, until it doesn't. Because make a simple little service is easy. Service 2 - 20 is also easy, but then you started to create something very complicated and entangled, and unless you look out you have a complex system that is impossible to wrap your head around. (For example by having each service being separately deployable and holding it's own data, but that's another blog post.)

### XP and Agile

Interesting enough `the simplest thing could possible work` was a phrase thrown around in the [project that created eXtreme Programming](http://wiki.c2.com/?DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork), and have stuck in the agile community in large. Why? Because `Simple == Good. Complex == Bad`.

I've spent 5 years designing education, writing lectures and labs. Which obviously involves rewrites of just about everything, many times. Because it turns out that not all people view the world as I did when I wrote the slides.

In these iterations I've often cursed myself for making the first version of the lab or lecture to large or encompassing too many topics. This is not a good way to learn. Bite-sized chunks of learning that you can put together in your mind is much better.

Also that is actually the way that we ended up designing the [SALT bootcamps](https://www.salt.study) - making each day being independent from other things. Making each week being independent from other weeks.

When we have succeeded with this it's easy to move things around and shift one day for another. When that is hard we have made something complex that has ties to many other things.

`Simple == Good. Complex == Bad`.

## Concluding thoughts

Aha - apparently the last section in the series will always be a personal reflection. Ok, then - let's do this.

I have made some "stupid" decisions in my career, just because it would give me a simpler life. I have, several times, taken a lower salary (or hourly rate) to get a better, simpler situation for my personal life.

I have *many* times done the opposite when it comes to my private life, taking on too much, being part of several groups simultaneously or trying to please many wills at once.

The simple answer (see what I did there...) is that created a complex situation, where a simple or even complicated one would have been better. I forgot that `Simple == Good. Complex == Bad`.

Here's the background image I use as my screensaver.
