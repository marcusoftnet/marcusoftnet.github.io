I am
just reading a [great
article](http://www.crisp.se/henrik.kniberg/ScrumAndXpFromTheTrenches.pdf)
which talks about how to use Scrum in a real project situation. It's an
really interesting and fun article.

However I am not yet convinced - it seems to be a lot of "that is not so
important", "approximately" and "document if you think that you need
it". I still miss the use case, the technical specifications and the
system architecture. Maybe if i read to the end i will be converted.

With that said; the methodology contains some very interesting concepts
and ideas, and i will most certainly incorporate elements already now.
