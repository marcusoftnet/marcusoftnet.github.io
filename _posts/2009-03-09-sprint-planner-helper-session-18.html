<p>I haven’t done to much on the Sprint Planner Helper project during this week. A lot of Salvation Army activities has taken up my time. </p>  <p>But I have read the blog post (in form of a <a href="http://dddstepbystep.com/r.ashx?2" target="_blank">PDF-book</a>) from <a href="http://dddstepbystep.com" target="_blank">DDD Step By Step</a>. I have read much of it before but sometimes other word clear things up for you. This book did it for me. </p>  <p>OK – what to do tonight (Abbe is sound asleep and Elin has gone to work). I have most of the stuff from my first two user stories in place. But I need a way to easy move product backlog item up and down in the list. This will come in handy when the product backlog items are estimated. </p>  <p>So I’ll introduce some methods to move the in the product backlog list. And some arrows in the GUI for the list. </p>  <p>Let’s write some lovely simple tests and see where it takes me.</p>  <p>[tap, tap, tap… Marcus is typing]</p>  <p>Oh my good – this was really to open a can of worms. I have to rework the product backlog class from a List&lt;ProductBacklogItem&gt; to class of it’s own. This is also to follow <a href="http://milano-xpug.pbwiki.com/f/10080616-extreme-oop.pdf" target="_blank">Extreme OOP</a> rule #8 – Use first-class collections, so it feel quite alright.     <br />Took me about 40 minutes to figure out though, my tests broke down…</p>  <p>The solution was quite simple. After I had reworked the ProductBacklog to not inherit List&lt;ProductBacklogItem&gt; I created a property that return the list in sorted order. The sorting was taken care of with this simple LINQ-statment:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>public List&lt;ProductBacklogItem&gt; ProductBacklogItems</p>    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; {</p>    <p>get</p>    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; {</p>    <p>var listToReturn = from item in productBacklogItems </p>    <p>orderby item.Priority </p>    <p>select item;</p>    <p>return listToReturn.ToList();</p>    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; }</p>    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; }</p>    <p></p> </blockquote>  <p>After adding an AddProductBacklogItem-method I was back on track with all green lights…</p>  <p>I was then at the edge of blowing my 1 hour rule. So I stopped. Tomorrow I’ll get back to my reprioritizing of item.</p>
