Found [this nugget](http://www.quickdiff.com/) today when comparing numerous very long SQL-strings. Yeah, yeah – I know; [data access is a solved problem](https://www.hibernate.org/343.html) – but this app still got them. In spades!

And I also agree with the developer of the tool:

“Now, although pretty much every IDE (and various stand-alone products) have sophisticated diff utilities built in (like Eclipse), my favourite, I got very tired of having to create two files just to paste in fragments of code or other bits of texts just in order to perform a diff and see the differences highlighted.”

Except for the Eclipse-part maybe. The diff tool worked great and helped me a lot yesterday. And probably today… and the day after that, and the day…
