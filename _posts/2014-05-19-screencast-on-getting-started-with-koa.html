<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I got a <a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2014/03/mnb-mongoosejs.html" target="_blank">comment from a reade</a>r. That's both encouraging and educating. Mr Robert Larsson asked me if I could show him and others how to write an API using <a href="http://www.koajs.com/" target="_blank">Koa Js</a>. Yes, sir. I can do that.<br /><br />I thought that I would try something different (for me) and did a screencast out of this. I had great fun doing this and it was a bit nervous to record this (would the internet act up, would any dogs or cats outside my house be audible), but the end result was pretty good I think (Elin opened our VERY squeaky door twice but other than that it came across fine.<br /><br /><a name='more'></a>Please let me know what you think about the content:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><object class="BLOGGER-youtube-video" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data-thumbnail-src="https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/aTTjednotGQ/0.jpg" height="266" width="320"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/aTTjednotGQ?version=3&f=user_uploads&c=google-webdrive-0&app=youtube_gdata" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><embed width="320" height="266"  src="https://www.youtube.com/v/aTTjednotGQ?version=3&f=user_uploads&c=google-webdrive-0&app=youtube_gdata" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">As always I learned a lot in the process, here's a few of the things that I picked up;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"></div><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Rehearse it!
