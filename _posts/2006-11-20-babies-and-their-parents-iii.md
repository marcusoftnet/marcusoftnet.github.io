OK - i was wrong, a bit at least.

Met my friends and their new daugther last Friday -and it's a completely
new life for them. Especially for the father. I was great to see
though - a lot of love in the air. So - the "still being us"-thing will
probably fade for a while but i am sure that it will come back and that
they will watch sopranos late at night even though the baby needs to
sleep.

But they will never fall into the super-parents-trap! I am sure of that
at least.
