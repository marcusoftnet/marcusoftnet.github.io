<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I'm writing down some of the things I've picked up when I started to learn about&nbsp;<a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Node</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://expressjs.com/" target="_blank">Express</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mongodb.org/" target="_blank">Mongo</a>.

That's SUPER testing people. That's all we really need...<br /><br />It's called&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest" target="_blank">supertest</a>&nbsp;since it depends on a module called&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent" target="_blank">super-agent</a>, an HTTP client. This is important to know since the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest" target="_blank">supertest</a>&nbsp;library is actually just extending the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent" target="_blank">super-agent</a>&nbsp;library. Many of the functions you&nbsp;use when writing tests with&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest" target="_blank">supertest</a>&nbsp;is defined in&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent" target="_blank">super-agent</a>. So if you need to look something up you&nbsp;might have to peek that the documentation of&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent" target="_blank">super-agent</a>.<br /><br />The&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest" target="_blank">supertest</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;library is very handy when it comes to test API and web applications and have a nice fluent interface that&nbsp;I immediately fell in love with. You install it, of course, with<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">npm install supertest</span></blockquote>As always the best way to show you this is with an example. Let's write a little test for a simple GET<br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/marcusoftnet/8816350.js"></script>See, that was very simple. Note the fluent interface and how you first compose your request (the <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">.get()</span> and <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">.set()</span> functions) and then we can do the expects, all in one statement. It's pretty nice, I think!<br /><br />The app object needs to be exported from the app-file so that the test can get hold of it. This is done with the<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">module.exports.getApp = app;</span>&nbsp;</blockquote>statement so it's not too bad. In return you get a very simple way of testing the express application that don't even have to be up and running, it's all in-process of the test. At least that's my current understanding of it.<br /><br />Now let's do a post as well and see how to send data to the server:<br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/marcusoftnet/8816590.js"></script></div>Here you can see me use the URL instead of the app-object. I (think that I) then have to make sure that the application is up and running so it's a bit more complex with more moving parts.<br /><br />If you need to test things that are under authentication there's a<a href="http://jaketrent.com/post/authenticated-supertest-tests/" target="_blank"> great post about that over here.&nbsp;</a><br /><br />There's not really much more to say about this framework. It's one of those - "it just works"-frameworks which is awesome. In doubt checkout the documentation for&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest" target="_blank">supertest</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent" target="_blank">super-agent</a>.&nbsp;</div>
