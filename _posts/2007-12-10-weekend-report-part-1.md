What a
weekend!
Phew - a most hectic period is to an end but it
all went very well - soon I will stop to worry about this. I fall into
the same trap each time...

Well - this Friday we finally did the Vasak√•rens
Jul - concert at Nybrokajen 11 in Stockholm. What a
hit it was - about 260 persons came (which is circa 100 more than last
year) and the reception from the audience was great. Also the Vasa Gospel,
Vasas
Granather
and the Vasa Band outperformed themselves.
With KarlMagnus Fredrikssson
as a highlight of the evening.

I am so proud of my corps - we really have nice atmosphere in the corps
and can still maintain high standards. I really like being a part of the

corps.
