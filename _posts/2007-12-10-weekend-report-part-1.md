What a
weekend!
Phew - a most hectic period is to an end but it
all went very well - soon i will stop to worry about this. I fall into
the same trap each time...

Well - this Friday we finally did the <span

Jul - concert at Nybrokajen 11 in Stockholm. What a
hit it was - about 260 persons came (which is circa 100 more than last
year) and the reception from the audience was great. Also the <span

Vasas
Granather
and the Vasa Band outperformed <span

With KarlMagnus <span

as a highlight of the evening.

I am so proud of my corps - we really have nice atmosphere in the corps
and can still maintain high standards. I really like being a part of the

corps.
