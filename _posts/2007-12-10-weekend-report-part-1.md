What a
weekend!
Phew - a most <span>="blsp-spelling-corrected">hectic</span> period is to an end but it
all went very well - soon i will stop to worry about this. I fall into
the same trap each time...

Well - this <span>="blsp-spelling-corrected">Friday</span> we finally did the <span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-error">Vasak√•rens</span>
Jul - concert at <span>="blsp-spelling-error">Nybrokajen</span> 11 in Stockholm. What a
hit it was - about 260 persons came (which is circa 100 more than last
year) and the reception from the audience was great. Also the <span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_4" class="blsp-spelling-error">Vasa</span> Gospel,
<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_5" class="blsp-spelling-error">Vasas</span>
<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_6" class="blsp-spelling-error">Granather</span>
and the <span>="blsp-spelling-error">Vasa</span> Band outperformed <span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_8" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">themselves</span>.
With <span>="blsp-spelling-error">KarlMagnus</span> <span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_10" class="blsp-spelling-error">Fredrikssson</span>
as a highlight of the <span>="blsp-spelling-corrected">evening</span>.

I am so proud of my corps - we really have nice atmosphere in the corps
and can still maintain high standards. I really like being a part of the
<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_12" class="blsp-spelling-error">Vasa</span>
corps.
