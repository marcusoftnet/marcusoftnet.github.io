The Göteborg Brass Band is terminated (as it's [said on the
web](http://www.goteborgbrassband.org.se/)) and it's now very
interesting to follow the different members on their way to other
band.

Top of the list must be that Patrik Randefalk is the new soloeuphonium
of the world-famous Eikanger-Bjørsvik band in Norway. This band is one
of the best bands in the movement if you ask me and I am sure that
Patrik will contribute to their continued successes. Good luck Patrik.
Looking forward to hearing the band with the low brass led by you!

[Windcorp Brass Band](http://www.windcorpbrassband.se/) has signed
several bandsmen from GBB already. In all honesty the band is made up
from former GBB players from the outset so that is all in the same
mindset. With these new players they will be very hard to beat. Also it
will be very interesting to hear the band. I sure it will sound great.

I will therefore right now make a prediction for the result of the
Swedish Championsships this autumn. As always, remember where you read
it first:

1. Windcorp - by far!
2. Stockholm Brass Band
3. Solna

This order of course has to do with who will take part of the
competition or not but this will most certainly be the order.
