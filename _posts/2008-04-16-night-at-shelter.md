Tonight i am sleeping at the Salvation Army shelter for homeless in
Stockholm. It is a very good way for me to take part the most important
work that the Salvation Army does, and that i am embarrising seldom
involved in.

Feels fine for now - i hope i don't mess things up, though. There are a
lot of things to keep track of and the people i am serving are used to a
certain standard and certain ways. I hope i don't let them down.

Bye for now - i'll get back to you after the night.
