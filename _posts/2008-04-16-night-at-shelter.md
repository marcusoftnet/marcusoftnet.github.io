Tonight I am sleeping at the Salvation Army shelter for homeless in Stockholm. It is a very good way for me to take part the most important work that the Salvation Army does, and that I am embarring seldom involved in.

Feels fine for now - I hope I don't mess things up, though. There are a lot of things to keep track of and the people I am serving are used to a certain standard and certain ways. I hope I don't let them down.

Bye for now - I'll get back to you after the night.
