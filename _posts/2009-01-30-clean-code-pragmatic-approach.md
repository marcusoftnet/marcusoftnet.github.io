As I wrote in the
<a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2009/01/last-day-new-chapter.html"
target="_blank">previous post</a> I am right now reading [Clean
Code](http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882)
by Robert "Uncle Bob" Martin. It is great!

But having 200 hundred pages book that contains rules about how to code
will pretty soon get hard. Especially if you try to adopt it in a team.

A while back we discussed an essay by Jeff Bay called Object
Calisthenics a lot in the Microsoft community at Avega. This is a
**very** pragmatic approach with 9 rules that states how to code.

Here is a
<a href="http://milano-xpug.pbwiki.com/f/10080616-extreme-oop.pdf"
target="_blank">pdf-version</a> of the rules.

What I found was that many of the rules that Uncle Bob is talking about
in Clean Code will be followed automatically if you adhere to the rules
in Object Calisthenics.

I'll try it out sometimes - but it looks like a quite bitter pill to
swallow when you look at the list... Brrr
