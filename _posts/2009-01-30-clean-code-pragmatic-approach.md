As I mentioned in my [previous post](https://www.marcusoft.net/2009/01/last-day-new-chapter.html), I am currently reading [Clean Code](http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) by Robert "Uncle Bob" Martin. It's a great book!

However, having a 200-page book with rules on coding can become overwhelming, especially when trying to adopt these practices within a team.

A while back, we discussed an essay by Jeff Bay called "Object Calisthenics" extensively in the Microsoft community at Avega. This essay offers a **very** pragmatic approach with 9 rules on how to code.

You can find a [PDF version](http://milano-xpug.pbwiki.com/f/10080616-extreme-oop.pdf) of the rules.

I found that many of the principles Uncle Bob discusses in *Clean Code* are naturally followed if you adhere to the rules in Object Calisthenics.

I'll try this approach out sometime. It does seem like a bit of a tough pill to swallow when you look at the list, though.
