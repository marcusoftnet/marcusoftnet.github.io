I have been introduced to a new concept called [The Pomodoro Technique](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/). It’s a way to work in a very focused and lean way, on the individual level (it can also be used for groups).

From what I’ve learned so far it seems very powerful and is something that I sure will be reading more about, and try to use for myself. I often have trouble to keep my focus on the task at hand and the Pomodoro Technique seems like a great way of handling that.

Here are some resources that I found on the subject:

- [Pomodoro Technique in 5 minutes](http://blog.staffannoteberg.com/2008/02/22/pomodoro-technique-in-5-minutes/)
- [Book](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/resources/cirillo/ThePomodoroTechnique_v1-3.pdf) from the inventor of Pomodoro, Francesco Cirillo
- [Pomodoro Technique Illustrated](http://www.pomodoro-book.com/DRAFT_pomodoro-book.pdf)

And finally a great lightning talk by [Staffan Nöteberg](http://blog.staffannoteberg.com/) on the problems that Pomodoro sets out to solve. In Swedish I am afraid…

[Here](http://blog.staffannoteberg.com/2009/01/10/pomodoro-technique-oredev-2008-video/) is a longer (50 min) version of the same talk in English.
