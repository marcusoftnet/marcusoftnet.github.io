Today when i bicycled to work it was, as always in Sweden this
season, dark. So in order to see anything i switched on my headlight on
the bike.

My bike is not very good so for the third time in a short while (broken
wheel, flat tire and not the headlight) something broke on the bike.

About 200 meters after the light had faded for the morning i met a guy.
He had just climed a steep hill and was not in a good mood. He probably
also was a person very concerned with following laws and regulations.
So, in a not very friendly mood, he shouted: "Maybe a lightbulb, don't
you think?"

Of course we had passed each other before i could think of any good
comeback. I laughed for while but then it has nagged me the whole day.
This is the basis for a whole Seinfeld episode where George tries to
recreate a situation just to be able to deliver a great comeback.

Instead of thinking of a comeback i started to wonder about that urge.
Everybody has it from time to time, i'm sure. What is the official term
for it? Comebacking? Revenge-urge?

I hope a great comeback will materialize itself in my brain before the
morning, and that i will meet the biker again... and that my light will
go out again... but then... sweet revenge
