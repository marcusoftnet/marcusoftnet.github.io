My band, the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" classVasa band of the Salvation
Army, is entering the busiest season of the year - the Christmas season!
I counted to 9 gigs during this season with different sizes of the
band.

If brassbanding had as much to do
during all of the year as under the Christmas season there would be a
lot of more professional bands around, i can
promise you.

One thing that strikes me every year this happens (i.e. almost every
year) is that it's so easy to get lost in the busy-ness surrounding
Christmas. This is also well known, we say this to each
other each year; but do we remember the true reason for Christmas: Jesus
and his coming to this earth for you and
me.

During the gigs we have we will have lots of opportunities to introduce pieces
and this will be my main theme this year; don't forget! For you, for
your sake - a gift. Jesus.

Alright - got a great idea last afternoon just before leaving work -
let's see if it's still around
