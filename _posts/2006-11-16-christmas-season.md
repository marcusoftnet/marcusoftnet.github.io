My band, the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-error"
onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)">Vasa</span> band of the Salvation
Army, is entering the busiest season of the year - the Christmas season!
I counted to 9 gigs during this season with different sizes of the
band.

If <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-error"
onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)">brassbanding</span> had as much to do
during all of the year as under the Christmas season there would be a
lot of more <span>="blsp-spelling-corrected">professional</span> bands around, i can
promise you.

One thing that strikes me every year this happens (i.e. almost every
year) is that it's so easy to get lost in the busy-<span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_3" class="blsp-spelling-error"
onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)">ness</span> <span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_4" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">surrounding</span>
Christmas. This is also <span>="blsp-spelling-corrected">well known</span>, we say this to each
other each year; but do we remember the true reason for Christmas: Jesus
and his <span>="blsp-spelling-corrected">coming</span> to this earth for you and
me.

During the gigs we have we will have lots of <span>="blsp-spelling-corrected">opportunities</span> to introduce pieces
and this will be my main theme this year; don't forget! For you, for
your sake - a gift. Jesus.

Alright - got a great idea last afternoon just before leaving work -
let's see if it's still around
