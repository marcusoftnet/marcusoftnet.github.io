From one of
the Visual Studio videos I got this tip:
<http://www.opensourcetemplates.org/>

It is a site that holds a lot of free templates (<span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-error">CSS and XHTML) that you
can use to build websites with. So now you have something to start off
with instead of hacking it all by yourself.

Especially good for me since i don't have any design-related cells at
all.
