Chuck
is back - a few years (i think) back there was some sites around the
Internet listing how hard the ex-action-hero Chuck Norris is.

You know Chuck, i presume - he's the hero of such great epic movies as
missing in action and foremost the long runner Walker Texas Ranger. They
are both crap and probably mr Norris shouldn't have gone into making
movies at the first place. He's a karate guy.

Anyhow - here is a list of the top quotes about how hard Chuck Norris
is.
