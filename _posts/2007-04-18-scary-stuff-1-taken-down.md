The
presentation yesterday went well. Just thought I'll drop that in here
since i have being bringing it up again and again.

About 120 people in the auditorium and circa 20-40 people listening in
via video-link... quite cool, even though it made the presentation a bit
harder. A funny (but nice) calmness came over me the minute i stepped up
on the stage. I also managed to keep the timing of the presentation down
to the minute (a first for me :))

The presentation was about SCRUM and it was quite well received. I've
heard several people talking about it (both positive and negative word)
already - which i take as a good thing. I could post the slides here if
only BlogSpot allowed me.

So - continuing today on my road to a working environment, but much
lesser amount of butterflies in the stomach...
