Got a tip of really fun site <http://www.expertvillage.com/>.

Here there are a lot of experts uploading videos of how to do stuff. So
if You wonder how a Sitar is played, how to build a new kitchen or how
to throw a American football - here is the place.

A lot of fun is guaranteed.

I couldn't find anything about the euphonium... yet. Might upload some
stuff there if i dare
