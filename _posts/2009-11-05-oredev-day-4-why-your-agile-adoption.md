This became so much and was so good that I publish it as a separate
post.

After pretty disappointing morning I’m hoping that
<a href="http://www.dannorth.com" target="_blank">Dan North</a> will
bring things back to great – as most of the day was yesterday.

Dan promised yesterday that he will bash on Scrum a lot in this talk…
And at the same time as this there is a talk on Entity Framework 2.0.
With <a href="http://www.ayende.com/" target="_blank">Ayende</a> and
<a href="http://blog.scottbellware.com/" target="_blank">Scott
Bellware</a> in the audience…

OK – our hall is filling up. Dan is smiling. Could be fun. Here are some
quotes:

-   A manager in a crappy system with a certificate is still a manager
    in a crappy system
-   Certified$crumMa$ter :)
-   Check out the <a
    href="http://www.stevenmsmith.com/my-articles/article/the-satir-change-model.html"
    target="_blank">Satir change model</a> to understand peoples
    reluctance to change
-   Think of the different stages of the <a
    href="http://blog.bruceabernethy.com/post/The-Dreyfus-Model-of-Skills-Acquisition.aspx"
    target="_blank">Dreyfus model</a>
-   “75% of **uncoached** Scrum projects will fail” – Ken Schweiber
-   Get a build/continuous integration! Because flushing out the
    problems around that process flesh out a lot of problems
-   Automate tests! Introduce assumptions test to test legacy code.
    Assumptions test is a way to document your assumptions on the legacy
    code.
-   Understand
    <a href="http://business-advice.vugg.net/search/Deliberate%20Discovery"
    target="_blank">Deliberate Discovery</a> around the domain, the
    architecture and the people.
-   <a
    href="http://www.project-management-knowledge.com/definitions/r/rolling-wave-planning/"
    target="_blank">Rolling wave planning</a> – only break the imminent
    stories to details.
-   Get good a writing stories; break features into stories, have them
    concisely small and then each story size is 1 story. Here he made a
    reference to “A slackers guide on project tracking”
-   WaterScrum – your sprint are too long Which gets you all the
    downsides of both Agile and Waterfall…
-   Go to one week sprints. Identify what hurts and fix it! Plan –\> Do
    –\> Check –\> Act
-   “I love failing. Its fun and is a great opportunity to learn”
-   Spent money is spent (on investment in tooling/processes) – instead
    think of the impact on effectiveness.
-   Build trust with the business – demonstrate and celebrate success,
    demonstrate transparency
-   Remember to get the “What’s in it for me!” to all parts of your
    value chain; operations, test, business, corporate and developers.
-   Projects (and their management) will not pay for change… “Not on my
    budget!”. Solve this by getting the project management responsible
    for the system lifecycle and make small changes frequently
-   Introduce a strategic change pot of money that transcends projects
-   On architects in Ivory towers: “I don’t write code anymore – Don’t
    you see my long white beard?” :D
-   Get the architect into the teams as consultants. Reward them for
    sharing knowledge.
-   Stewart leadership – leadership by getting coffee.
-   Integrate tester into the team and invest in automated testing.
-   Systematic change requires systemically change
-   “A bad system will beat a good person every time.” – Edward Deming

I’ve run into many of these problems and thought hard on much of the
solutions but this was so crisp and good.
