Today’s session with [Dan North](http://www.dannorth.com) was a standout. Following a somewhat disappointing morning, Dan’s talk was exactly what I needed to rejuvenate my enthusiasm.

Dan had promised a critical look at Scrum, and he delivered. Here are some key takeaways from his session:

- *“A manager in a crappy system with a certificate is still a manager in a crappy system.”*
- *“Certified$crumMa$ter :)”*
- Refer to the [SATIR Change Model](http://www.stevenmsmith.com/my-articles/article/the-satir-change-model.html) to understand people’s resistance to change.
- Consider the [Dreyfus Model](http://blog.bruceabernethy.com/post/The-Dreyfus-Model-of-Skills-Acquisition.aspx) for skill acquisition stages.
- Ken Schweiber’s assertion: *“75% of un-coached Scrum projects will fail.”*
- Implement continuous integration and automated tests to reveal and address underlying issues.
- Use assumption tests to document assumptions on legacy code.
- Embrace [Deliberate Discovery](http://business-advice.vugg.net/search/Deliberate%20Discovery) in domain understanding, architecture, and team dynamics.
- Practice [Rolling Wave Planning](http://www.project-management-knowledge.com/definitions/r/rolling-wave-planning/) to detail only imminent stories.
- Write concise stories and break features into manageable pieces.
- Beware of "WaterScrum," where long sprints can lead to drawbacks of both Agile and Waterfall methodologies.
- Shorten sprints to one week, identify pain points, and address them using the Plan -> Do -> Check -> Act cycle.
- *“I love failing. It’s fun and is a great opportunity to learn.”*
- Focus on the impact on effectiveness rather than just the cost of investments in tools and processes.
- Build trust with the business by demonstrating and celebrating successes, and maintaining transparency.
- Ensure all parts of your value chain understand “What’s in it for me?” including operations, testing, business, corporate, and development.
- Address the challenge of project management resistance to change by integrating lifecycle management and making frequent small changes.
- Establish a strategic fund for changes that transcend individual projects.
- Challenge the “Ivory Tower” mindset among architects; involve them in teams as consultants and reward knowledge sharing.
- Adopt Stewart leadership—lead by supporting and facilitating team needs (e.g., getting coffee).
- Integrate testers into the team and invest in automated testing.
- Recognize that systemic change requires a systemic approach.
- *“A bad system will beat a good person every time.”* – Edward Deming

Dan North’s presentation was a crisp and insightful analysis of common agile adoption pitfalls and solutions. It was a much-needed boost, reinforcing many of the challenges and strategies I’ve encountered in my own work.
