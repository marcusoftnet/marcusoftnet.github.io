Read a great
[article](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/05/01/ASPNETPerformance/)
about performance in ASP.NET applications.

However what really caught my eye was the sidebar about performance
myths. [Read it
here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/05/01/ASPNETPerformance/default.aspx?loc=&side=true#a).

Some of those were new to me and some old, which but i have so many
times tried to explain to customers (such the one about different speed
on VB.NET and C#-code). So nice to have a place to point to...
