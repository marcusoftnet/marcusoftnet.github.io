Another [night on the
shelter](http://www.marcusoft.net/2008/04/night-at-shelter.html) for the
Salvation Army. Today it has been quite warm outside but for the men
visiting the shelter that only means that they will arrive a bit
later.

Just think for yourself, when you walk home late a summer night, even if
it is warm - would you trade that for a bed? I know i wouldn't...

I am always filled with some sort of sorrow when I see the guest here at
the shelter. They are, many of them, younger than me. And already they
are on the bottom of our society... Others have been there for years and
years.

We are so <span>="blsp-spelling-corrected">privileged</span> in our daily <span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">lives</span> and
so seldom stop and <span>="blsp-spelling-corrected">appreciate</span> it. Most of us have
families, friends and co-workers that cares about how we are doing. We
have stuff to do (work for example) - <span>="blsp-spelling-corrected">that's</span> another thing to ponder.
What would you do if you didn't have anything to do? I know I'll go
crazy pretty soon.

All of this might sound like <span>="blsp-spelling-corrected">cliches</span> - but I dare you; think
about it and you will most certainly think different of the people that
doesn't fit in our well organized world.

Tonight my prayers will go to all those men and women. And also to the
people working with and helping them.
