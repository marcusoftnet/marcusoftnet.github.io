I have this last week got two very real answers to my and other peoples
prayers.

I am still amazed that I still become amazed that prayers are answered.

But that is how it is – it works. So if you ever find yourself in peril
just put your hands together and whisper “Jesus – help me now!”.

He will hear you!
