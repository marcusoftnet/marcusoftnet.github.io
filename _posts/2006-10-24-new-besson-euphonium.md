Phew!
After some turbulent times for Besson they are now back.... with some
new euphonium models too.

That would be something to dream of

Pretty cool that a new Sovereign models is released. I always thought
that Besson had abandonded them for Prestige. The Prestige is just to
expensive for hobby-players like myself... maybe when I am a
millionaire..
