This is
the most creative, flipped out, and maybe scary thing I've ever read on
a technical subject - <http://poignantguide.net/ruby/>

It's a online book about Ruby. But the guy who has written it seems a
little.... odd to say the least. He has really taken the concept of
learning to a whole new level. Bad or good - judge for yourselves.
