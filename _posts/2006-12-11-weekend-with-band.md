Just back
from a wonderful weekend with the <span>="blsp-spelling-error"
onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)">Gothenburg</span> Brass Band. I had
the wonderful <span>="blsp-spelling-corrected">opportunity</span> to spend the entire
weekend together with the band and it made me feel again as a part of
this wonderful group.

We did three sold out concerts and a late night party, not counting the
rehearsals and good times together. Although i was thorn apart by not
playing in the band (did a few subs though; <span>="blsp-spelling-error"
onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)">euphonium</span>, baritone and <span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_3"
class="blsp-spelling-corrected">percussion</span>!) i immediately felt
the warmth and spirit of the band.

The weekend also celebrated the 25<span>="blsp-spelling-error" onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)">th</span>
<span>="blsp-spelling-corrected">anniversary</span> of the band and a lot
of the celebrations was, with due right, directed to Bengt <span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_6" class="blsp-spelling-error"
onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)">Eklund</span> - the founder, director
and inspiration for the band during all these years. By now <span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_7" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">everyone</span>
knows that Bengt is ill and it felt very good to be able to do such a
good show and party for his sake.

The shows contained some really wonderful soloist; Jonas <span

onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)">Olsson</span> on the piano, Karolina
<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_9" class="blsp-spelling-error"
onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)">Andersson</span> who sung marvelously
and the fun and <span>="blsp-spelling-corrected">well playing</span> <span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_11" class="blsp-spelling-error"
onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)">dr</span> Bob <span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_12" class="blsp-spelling-error"
onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)">Kase</span>.

I had a great time with the band and a great time <span

onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)">MC'ing</span> the whole thing - it was
a <span>="blsp-spelling-corrected">privilege</span> to be part of it all.
