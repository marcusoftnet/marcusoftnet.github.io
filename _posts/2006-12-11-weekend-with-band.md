Just back
from a wonderful weekend with the Gothenburg Brass Band. I had
the wonderful opportunity to spend the entire
weekend together with the band and it made me feel again as a part of
this wonderful group.

We did three sold out concerts and a late night party, not counting the
rehearsals and good times together. Although I was thorn apart by not
playing in the band (did a few subs though; euphonium, baritone and <span

class="blsp-spelling-corrected">percussion!) I immediately felt
the warmth and spirit of the band.

The weekend also celebrated the 25="blsp-spelling-error" onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)">th
anniversary of the band and a lot
of the celebrations was, with due right, directed to Bengt Eklund - the founder, director
and inspiration for the band during all these years. By now everyone
knows that Bengt is ill and it felt very good to be able to do such a
good show and party for his sake.

The shows contained some really wonderful soloist; Jonas <span

and the fun and well playing <span

I had a great time with the band and a great time <span

a privilege to be part of it all.
