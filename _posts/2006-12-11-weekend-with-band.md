Just back
from a wonderful weekend with the Gothenburg Brass Band. I had
the wonderful opportunity to spend the entire
weekend together with the band and it made me feel again as a part of
this wonderful group.

We did three sold out concerts and a late night party, not counting the
rehearsals and good times together. Although i was thorn apart by not
playing in the band (did a few subs though; euphonium, baritone and <span

class="blsp-spelling-corrected">percussion!) i immediately felt
the warmth and spirit of the band.

The weekend also celebrated the 25="blsp-spelling-error" onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)">th
anniversary of the band and a lot
of the celebrations was, with due right, directed to Bengt Eklund - the founder, director
and inspiration for the band during all these years. By now <span

knows that Bengt is ill and it felt very good to be able to do such a
good show and party for his sake.

The shows contained some really wonderful soloist; Jonas <span

and the fun and well playing <span

I had a great time with the band and a great time <span

a privilege to be part of it all.
