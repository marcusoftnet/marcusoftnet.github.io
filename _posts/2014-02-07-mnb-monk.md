I'm writing down some of the things I've picked up when I started to
learn

This post is about
<a href="https://github.com/LearnBoost/monk" target="_blank">monk</a>, a
nice framework that makes accessing
<a href="http://www.mongodb.org/" target="_blank">MongoDb</a> really
easy.

When doing database work with
<a href="http://www.nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Node</a>, the default
option seems to
be <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/" target="_blank">MongoDb</a>. This
is of course very natural since Mongo itself is Javascript and stores
JSON objects. I have no problem at all with that, since I've used Mongo
before and like it a lot.

When accessing Mongo from Node, the default option seems to be
<a href="http://mongoosejs.com/" target="_blank">Mongoose</a>. It seems
like a very nice and capable framework, but it enforces a typed model to
be declared, before you can use Mongoose in your code. I have some
problems with that.
Firstly it seems to go against the Node/Javascript concepts where not
much is statically typed. Secondly, in Mongo there is no types and you
can store whatever you want in a collection (kinda table for relational
people). Thirdly, I have been using
<a href="https://github.com/markrendle/Simple.Data"
target="_blank">Simple.Data</a> for so long that the idea of having to
create a model just to be able to get some data out of a database seems
unnecessary complex to me.
Then again... using the
<a href="http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/"
target="_blank">native Mongo driver for node</a>, doesn't look to
attractive to me. But I rather do that then using a model... So I was
between a rock and a hard place.

I then found out about
<a href="https://github.com/kissjs/node-mongoskin"
target="_blank">MongoSkin</a> (you guys and your framework names...),
that looked much more attractive. MongoSkin is built directly on top of
the native Mongo driver but takes away much of the complexity and gives
you a nicer API to program against, in my opinion.
Using MongoSkin led me to
<a href="https://github.com/LearnBoost/monk" target="_blank">Monk</a>
and I felt back at home. Monk has a nice, slick API that gets out of my
way and lets me just do the work. Not a declared model as far as the eye
can see.  Monk is built on top of MongoSkin, which in turn is built on
top of the native Mongo driver... So it all goes together.

### The API

<div>

If there's something to be said against Monk it is that the
documentations is not that easy to digest. But since it's just a wrapper
of MongoSkin you can sometimes fall back to the MongoSkin documentation
and it just works. And if that is failing... MongoSkin is a wrapper and
you can go to the Mongo Driver Native wrapper. We'll see that in play
shortly. In fact, some people who know the native driver or MongoSkin
might object and say that the features I describe actually belongs to
MongoSkin or the native driver. I really don't care, I just like the
Monk-syntax.

Let's see Monk in action (hey that's a cool book title) in some
<a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2014/02/mnb-monk.html"
target="_blank">mocha</a> tests.

</div>

#### Connecting

<div>

Setting up a connection is trivial and can be done with this simple line




This gives you a database of which you can access the other properties
you need. Like the collections for example, like we do in the other
test. Quite often it's a good idea to actually get a reference to a
collection while you're at it.

</div>

<div>

All the interesting work is done from the collection object, so I often
create this in my initialization code. For tests, that would be in a
<span
style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">beforeEach-function: 

</div>
#### Add stuff in

<div>

Yes, I'm writing *stuff* in the title. Should have been *documents* I
guess. But often, the thing that we're adding is not that visible in our
code. Its just a data structure and we don't really need to care how it
looks like. Since we're just adding (deleting or getting) them from the
database. That's why I have a problem with a model being enforced upon
me. The concept in Mongo is schema**less** and hence a model feels
contrived. 

</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>

Oh yes, adding stuff. Here are some simple ways of inserting data:

</div>
#### Update stuff already in there

<div>

Updating is rather easy, the update function first takes a query
parameter, that tells **what** to update, and then the instruction on
**how** to update. It looks funky but is really powerful since that
means that it's easy to write updates for many documents at once:

</div>
#### Delete stuff

Deleting documents is really simple and just takes a query that tells us
what to remove

You can also drop collections all together, like in the <span
style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">after-function
at the end:
#### Find stuff that's in there

<div>

Querying data is the most powerful and hence complex features. I've put
together some tests that shows off the capabilities that I've come to
use and like:

That options structure, at the end of the tests, is a story of its own
then it was the options-structure. This is a VERY powerful feature that
confused me for a long time. There's an parameter to the find-methods
(that trickles down all the way to the native mongo driver) that
configures your query. With this you can limit the number of results,
sort the result, have it explain the query for you and you can probably
ask it to make coffee too. The complete <a
href="http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/markdown-docs/queries.html#query-options"
target="_blank">description of all the options can be found here.</a>

</div>

<div>

Here are options I've used so far:

</div>

<div>

-   <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">limit
    {Number, default:0} - sets the limit of documents returned in
    the query.
-   <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">sort
    {Array \| Object} - set to sort the documents coming back
    from the query. Array of fields and the asc/desc property, like this
    <span
    style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">\[\[‘field
    name’, 'desc'\]\].
-   <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">skip
    {Number, default:0} - set to skip N documents ahead in your
    query. Together with limit this makes for quite easy handling of
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pagination"
    target="_blank">pagination</a>

</div>

<div>

Once you get over the initial fear of having all those JSON-object
literals being passed into the function (that at least scared me at
first) it's a very nice terse syntax.

### RoboMongo

Almost forgot... To view and handle Mongo databases my tool of choice is
<a href="http://robomongo.org/" target="_blank">RoboMongo</a>. Go get it
now. It's free. It's awesome.
