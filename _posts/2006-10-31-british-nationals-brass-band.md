The Nationals (British Nationals that is) of this year has been battled
out this weekend. And since the test piece was "easier" than usually a
surprising result were to be expected.

However this did not happen, but it was good to see Grimethorpe (for all
you non-brass-people, that is the band that starred in Brassed Off) take
a big title. They have only won entertainment stuff for a while and is
such a great band so they deserved it.

Black Dyke missed out on a double (Open + Nationals) but still is
**always** up there. Impressive.

When will Buy as You View Cory (third) ever win something? They haven't
done that in a while, to my knowledge. Maybe time to turn away from the
old style playing that they are into (with fast, uncontrolled vibrato as
one of the main feature).
