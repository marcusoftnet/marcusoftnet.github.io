The last day of work before Christmas has contained some major breakthroughs in the project. I'll post these on the blog when they are documented.

But also there has been time for some fun greetings from friends. Here the best one so far - with me dancing which is rather unique: <http://www.elfyourself.com/?userid=0f3137be6d86ca0fc1a19e4G06122202>

Merry Christmas!
