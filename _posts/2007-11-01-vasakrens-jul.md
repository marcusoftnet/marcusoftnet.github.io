My corps, the Vasa corps of the Salvation Army, is
gifted with many very good musical talents. For example
Vasa
Gospel, Vasas Granater (youth gospel) and the VasaBand.

Each year we get together and perform a Christmas concert. This year i
am in a group that put that concert together. It will be on [Nybrokajen
11](http://www.nybrokajen11.rikskonserter.se/) and will include the
mentioned groups and also some guests, for example [Karl-Magnus <span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_8"
class="blsp-spelling-error">Fredriksson](http://www.musiken.nu/).

It will be a magnificent concert and hopefully something to remember for
a long time. You can, and should, buy ticket now:

Go ahead - invite a friend or two. But hurry - it's only 600 tickets all
in all...
