Today I did something that I never dared before - I posted a comment on
an article that I read in
<a href="http://computersweden.idg.se/" target="_blank"><span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_0"
class="blsp-spelling-error">ComputerSweden</span></a>. Nothing scary
there - but the article was written by one of the IT-<span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-error">heros</span> of
Sweden,
<a href="http://www.ivarjacobson.com/" target="_blank">Ivar <span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-error">Jacobsson</span></a>.
He invented <span>="blsp-spelling-error">RUP</span> and has been a busy debater and
writer.

His column was about Scrum and how it's "<span>="blsp-spelling-corrected">coming</span> apart" (my translation).
You can <a
href="http://computersweden.idg.se/2.2683/1.222111/det-knakar-rejalt-i-scrums-fogar"
target="_blank">read it here</a> (in Swedish).

Here are <a
href="http://computersweden.idg.se/2.2683/1.222111/det-knakar-rejalt-i-scrums-fogar?articleRenderMode=listpostings"
target="_blank">my comment</a> and Ivar's promptly answer.

The last row was something extra: "Marcus, you're welcome to write to me
directly" :)

I can't miss out on that <span>="blsp-spelling-corrected">opportunity</span>, can I.
