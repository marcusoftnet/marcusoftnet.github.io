Today I did something that I never dared beforeâ€”I posted a comment on an article I read in [ComputerSweden](http://computersweden.idg.se/). Nothing scary there, but the article was written by one of the IT heroes of Sweden, [Ivar Jacobsson](http://www.ivarjacobson.com/). He invented RUP and has been a busy debater and writer.

His column was about Scrum and how it's "coming apart" (my translation). You can [read it here](http://computersweden.idg.se/2.2683/1.222111/det-knakar-rejalt-i-scrums-fogar) (in Swedish).

Here are [my comment](http://computersweden.idg.se/2.2683/1.222111/det-knakar-rejalt-i-scrums-fogar?articleRenderMode=listpostings) and Ivar's prompt answer.

The last line was something extra: "Marcus, you're welcome to write to me directly" :)

I can't miss out on that opportunity, can I?
