Just some short lines of praise to an excellent web GUI to
access TFS (Team Foundation Server) - [Team
plain](http://www.teamplain.com/).

Via this GUI you can easily access most
functionality for TFS in a very nice manner. And this
have to be the nicest Web-GUI i've ever seen. I could possibly be
because it's using AJAX - and
then my friends the future promises good thing for us.
