OK - this seems to be a problem that <a href="http://www.google.se/search?hl=sv&amp;q=asp.net+mvc+404&amp;meta=">many people have run into</a>.  But for IIS 6 it seems to be some additional configuration that is needed in order to get ASP.NET MVC up and running.<br /><br />First you'll need to find the version of IIS. Yes, I know, it should be simple, but it's not... <a href="http://classicasp.aspfaq.com/general/how-do-i-determine-which-version-of-iis/asp-i-m-running.html">Here is how you do it.</a><br /><br />Then, when you know which one, and if it's IIS6 or lower (i presume...) you can follow <a href="http://www.techdreams.org/microsoft/aspnet/how-to-fix-404-errors-of-aspnet-mvc-website-deployed-on-iis-6-windows-server-2003/2572-20090515/comment-page-1#comment-9012">along nicely in this article</a> by <a class="url" href="http://www.techdreams.org/" rel="external nofollow">Gopinath</a> - who saved my butt.
