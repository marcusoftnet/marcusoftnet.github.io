As I [wrote earlier](http://www.marcusoft.net/2009/09/marcus-doing-new-stuff.html), I attended my first ever [Alt.Net un-conference](http://www.altdotnet.se/) this weekend. It was a rewarding experience, and meeting fellow developers in such an informal setting was fantastic. The [open spaces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology) were particularly valuable.

One of the open spaces I participated in focused on [Pair Programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming). The discussion quickly evolved into how to persuade developers, management, and others that it’s a beneficial practice.

Here is a recap of some of the insightful points from that session:

### Good Ideas

- **Switch the keyboard often:** One developer writes the test and another handles the implementation, or use a [Pomodoro](http://www.marcusoft.net/2009/08/pomodoro-being-agile-and-focused-on.html) timer for ten-minute intervals.
- **Switch partners frequently:** For example, once a day.

### Arguments for the Benefits of Pair Programming

- **It’s fun!** This alone is a strong argument. Enjoying your work is essential.
- [Here is a list of benefits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming#Benefits) and some [studies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming#Scientific_studies) showing improvements in quality.
- It may be slower initially but leads to faster production in the long run.
- Higher quality due to immediate feedback from the partner.
- More familiarity with the codebase among team members.
- Increased concentration with fewer interruptions, both internal and external.
- [Here is a paper](http://collaboration.csc.ncsu.edu/laurie/Papers/XPSardinia.PDF) indicating that while there may be a 15% tempo loss, the quality gains are substantial.

If there are still doubts, try pair programming for a sprint and assess the results. Adjust what isn’t working as needed.
