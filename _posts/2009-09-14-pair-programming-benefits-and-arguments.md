As I
<a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2009/09/marcus-doing-new-stuff.html"
target="_blank">wrote earlier</a> I attended my first ever
<a href="http://www.altdotnet.se/" target="_blank">Alt.Net
un-conference</a> this weekend. It was very rewarding and great to meet
fellow developers under such informal circumstances. The
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology"
target="_blank">open spaces</a> was the most rewarding part I think.

One of the open spaces I took part in were about
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming"
target="_blank">Pair Programming</a>. It soon evolved to a session about
how to convince developers / management and other that it’s a good idea.

Here is a short recap of some of the good thoughts that emerged from
that session.

#### Good ideas

-   Switch the keyboard often. I.e. one developer writes the test and
    one the implementation or use some kind of a <a
    href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2009/08/pomodoro-being-agile-and-focused-on.html"
    target="_blank">pomodoro</a> clock for ten mintues.
-   Switch partners often – once a day for example

#### Argument for the benefits of Pair Programming

-   It’s fun! No more agrument should really be needed than this. You
    need fun at work or else you should work somewhere else.
-   This is a
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming#Benefits"
    target="_blank">list of benefits here</a> and then some studies that
    shows an <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming#Scientific_studies"
    target="_blank">increase in quality etc.</a>
-   It may be slower to the first checking but faster to production
-   A higher quality to immediate quality checking by the partner
-   More people is familiar around the code-base
-   Higher degree of concentration and fewer interruptions, both
    internal and external.
-   <a href="http://collaboration.csc.ncsu.edu/laurie/Papers/XPSardinia.PDF"
    target="_blank">Here is a paper</a> that states that you do loose
    tempo (15 % in their studies) but you gain in quality

Yeah – that pretty much sums up what we talked about. And finally, if
they still are uncertain, try it for a sprint and see. And change what
isn’t working.
