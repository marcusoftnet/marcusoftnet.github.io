The foremost telephone number search service in Sweden, [www.hitta.se](http://www.hitta.se/) , has launched a new service that displays maps of the four biggest cities in Sweden in 3D.

It is still in beta (and as such quite slow) but it's really cool. Of course it's a [Google earth](http://earth.google.com/) rip-off but it has a few advantages; it runs in the browser, its genuine pictures of the buildings and no models and it's very high resolution.

Here you go - [Sweden in 3D](http://www.hitta.se/3d/3d_splash.aspx).
