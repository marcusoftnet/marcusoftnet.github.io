The <span>="blsp-spelling-corrected">foremost</span> <span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">telephone
number</span> search service in Sweden,
[www.hitta.se](http://www.hitta.se/) , has launched a new service that
displays maps of the four biggest cities in Sweden in 3D.

It is still in beta (and as such quite slow) but it's really cool. Of
course it's a [Google earth](http://earth.google.com/) <span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">rip</span>-off but
it has a few advantages; it runs in the browser, its genuine pictures of
the buildings and no models and it's very high resolution.

Here you go - [Sweden in 3D](http://www.hitta.se/3d/3d_splash.aspx).
