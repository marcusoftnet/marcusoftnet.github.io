I’m a programmer. But I, for some strange reason, often find myself
doing management consulting on different levels. Since my basic
schooling is in programming I ~~sometimes~~ often find myself using
principles that works well for programming in management.

One such principle was something I picked up about 10 years ago and I’m
still reaching for that everyday. Here’s my current desktop background,
showing that principle to me everyday:

This is a so called
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truism" target="_blank">truism</a>
that nobody says again, but I fail to reach just about all the time. I
find it very useful as a guiding north star both in organizations and
programming. But what does it really mean?

I have the good fortune to coach some managers in my current position
and today we got to talk about that statement above with one of them.
She obviously bought into that, as do we all, but I thought I’d try to
explain what Simple and Complex mean for me:

To me simple is made up of two components (I think, might add  stuff
here later): *transparency* and *short feedback loops.*

# Transparency and trust

Transparent in turn means that the things we do is open and showed to
others within our organization and as far as we think it’s reasonable.
This is one of the principles we built
<a href="http://www.aptitud.se" target="_blank">Aptitud</a> on and we’re
pushing the envelope on this. You can see the way we calculate salaries
on our website, every invoice is distributed to everyone in the company
as are all the pay slips etc. etc.

By having the information as transparent possible (as suitable) people
will start to ask questions. Because now they see the information in
broad daylight, and they wonder why a number is like that, or they might
know that statement to be changed, or they have an idea on how to
improve on X.

for the record, an intranet will not be sufficient. Put it out in the
hallway! Make it big! I dare you to do an experiment to measure the
different. Create a beautiful page on your intranet with some important
number visualized and pretty. Then try a really ugly, hand drawn diagram
and put it somewhere where everyone pass (close to the reception?). Note
the difference in the number of questions or comments. To the right is
one example from yesterday.

Two very simple things that we have tried lately is:

- make a board with a post-it for every task we’re doing. Do 3 columns
    (To do, Doing & Done), meet everyday and ask people how every task
    is going (see below). Only that. Yeah, this is a the embryo to a
    <a href="http://bit.ly/theKanbanBook" target="_blank">kanban</a>
    board. But very simplified.
    For the current situation I’m helping to improve the communication
    in the organization. And by using this simple tool it was restarted
    in minutes. Just by showing people the information.
- Create a hand drawn diagram (like the one above) for some important
    metric your organization is trying to reach. Put it close to the
    entrance for the employees. Update it daily. Ask people what they
    think about that number, or if they want to track another number.

Transparency is not only about visualization of course, although that’s
really important for reach. It’s also a mindset to share information
rather than keeping it to myself. And if you’re going to share the
information people need to feel safe to do so. To me transparency
without trust is not really worthwhile. Because people will not be
transparent.

If you go “Show me the numbers!”, or “Mr Andersson! Why is the <a
href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/content/moh_web/home/statistics/healthcare_institutionstatistics/Beds_Occupancy_Rate_BOR.html"
target="_blank">BOR</a> lower today than yesterday?” – people will lie
to you. They will tell you the numbers you want to hear. But if you want
the truth you will also show the people that even bad news are welcome.
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReRcHdeUG9Y"
target="_blank">Simon Sinek talks</a> about the main task of a manager
as being a safe environment. I think I kinda like that.

In my current team we try to solve that but often restating that;

> There are no good or bad news. There are just news

I could go on for hours on transparency, but let me just leave you with
one more thought; if you’re experience corruption in your organization,
what would transparency do for you? What kind of questions would arise?
What kind of information would be presented? What will the people
involved in the corruption do?

Transparency is a powerful tool. Using it will uncover things. Are you
ready to handle that?

# Short feedback loops– making it concrete often

other part of Simple is to me short feedback loops. For example, when we
create the board with task as above, we meet *daily* to talk about it.
This has a number of advantages over meeting once a week:

- the information is current
- the meeting feels relevant
- the meeting is short
- problems that will occur (I’m saying anything else) will be small

Funnily enough; if you meet seldom you can go through that list and make
the opposites… And you <a
href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2014/06/controlling-disappointment-dial.html"
target="_blank">control the dial for that too</a>.

There’s been miles of
<a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/itsNotJustStandingUp.html"
target="_blank">text written about meeting daily</a> so lets just focus
on the last bullet for now.  This connects the short feedback loops with
the other part of the heading – making things concrete often.

When doing software development nowadays we try to make things concreter
earlier by for example:

- writing test cases on how the functionality should work before we
    write the application. In order to do so we have to think about HOW
    the system should work without being bogged down with WHAT we need
    to build to make that happen.
- we run automated tests often. Several times an hours. Because this
    makes our current progress concrete. “Now that I’ve changed this
    little calculation, does everything else work?”
- we deploy to production often. Several times a day. Even for big
    sites like
    <a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a> (did you
    see
    <a href="https://twitter.com/marcusoftnet/status/479463187612315649"
    target="_blank">this little feature</a> they deployed without
    telling anyone for example),
    <a href="http://www.facebook.com" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and
    <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Because if
    it’s in production it is as concrete as it gets for software: it’s
    being used, by real users.

Examples in the business world might be:

- post the cash from the cashier to the bank everyday, so that we get
    a concrete summation for every day.
- track progress towards our project goal daily, so that we don’t go
    astray for a long time before being noticed about it
- automate the creating of financial statements for the company so
    that it can be created daily, so that we with little or no effort
    can create this and have granular progress tracking

Let’s note two things about the lists above but not by doing another
list, shall we:

### Problems will still occur

But they will be smaller. <a
href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2014/06/waiting-is-bad-for-you-and-its-worse.html"
target="_blank">The longer you wait – the bigger the problem</a>. You
control that dial. How much are you willing to pay (to call the meeting,
do the reporting, create the automation) to not have big problems, but
rather small? This is a business decision.
Here’s an example from the world of accounting.

> If you post the cash to the bank everyday you get an opportunity to
> check, that your accounting is correct according the actual cash, once
> a day. If it’s totally wrong it’s still just a problem that; occurred
> during the day, firstly, and only during that day secondly. Since it
> occurred during the day you remember it pretty well (I hope <img

> class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-confusedsmile"
> style="border-top-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-left-style: none"
> alt="Confused smile" />). Since it only occurred during the day in
> question the problem cannot be that complex to untangle.
>
> On the other hand: if you post to the bank on a monthly basis, you get
> the opportunity to verify your accounting against the concrete money
> once a month. Any  problems might have grown big and you will have a
> hard time remembering what you did up to 30 days back.

### Doing the work will take some effort but be faster

Creating this kind of fast moving processes, or creating the possibility
to have short iterations is hard work. Sometimes. For example, creating
automated tests for your entire system will take a lot of time.
Especially if you haven’t written tests from the beginning. Or creating
an automated process to create financial statements will not be easy to
start.

This is an investment for the organization. An investment to improve and
shorten the feedback loop. An investment to give the organization more
frequent opportunities to change and react. How much you want to invest
in that is up to you.

# Ok, that was the Simple part - Complex then, what is that?

Well… it’s basically the opposite of the above:

- the opposite of transparency is *hiding information,* often in
    complicated process built in for control, since the information is
    hidden…. \[big breath\] often in complicated process built for
    control of the process, since the information is not open and known
    in the company. This often creates more complicated processes that’s
    needed to control…
    I’ll stop there. Continue for as long as you see it fit.
- the opposite of short feedback loops are *long feedback loops* and
    making things *concrete seldom*. For example, deploying software 3-4
    times a year. Making each release risky, hard and complicated. Or
    creating a financial statement only at the end of each year,
    spending weeks to do so.

# Dude, you lost me… Can you sum it up again?

for both programming, life and in management of different sized
organizations followed the principle of Simple = Good, Complex = Bad.
That is I always try to simplify things, even the things I’ve
simplified. I’m never done. I hope.

Simple to me means transparent and doing things in short iterations.
Transparent so that as many as possible knows the information and can
see it, think about it, question it and suggest new ideas. And feel safe
doing so. Short iterations so that we quickly get feedback on our
actions, so that we’re rather working with small things quickly than big
(or a lot of small) slowly.
