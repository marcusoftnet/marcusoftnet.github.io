Just now the Intellisense stopped working in Visual Studio 2008. Scared
me a lot - since I thought that it would make me re-install the complete
Visual Studio 2008. That took me at least 3 hours to install.

But Richard Fennell had the solution and that helped me to evade that
situation. Here is the solution:

As it turns out this was only part of the solution. The real problem was
the integration with ReSharper - [here is how to solve
