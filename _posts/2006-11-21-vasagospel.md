I
listened to [Vasa Gospel](http://www.vasagospel.com/), and their CD
Precious Lord on the way in.

They are a gospel choir from my corps in the Salvation army. Great! This
CD is so well sung, well produced and well played. If you only hear one
gospel CD in your life then this is a pretty good candidate.
