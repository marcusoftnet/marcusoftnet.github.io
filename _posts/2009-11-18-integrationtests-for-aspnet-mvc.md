While exploring integration testing, I came across a [great article](http://blog.codeville.net/2009/06/11/integration-testing-your-aspnet-mvc-application/) that offers a clever approach to integration and regression testing for [ASP.NET MVC](http://www.asp.net/mVC/) applications.

The techniques described in the article complement the ideas I discussed in [a previous post on agile testing](http://www.marcusoft.net/2009/11/agile-testing-some-thoughts-after.html), and they present a streamlined method for ensuring your MVC applications perform as expected.

Check it out if you're interested in enhancing your testing strategies for ASP.NET MVC applications.
