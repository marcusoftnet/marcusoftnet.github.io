[Lizard Optimization](https://leanpub.com/lizardoptimization) is another great book by Gojko Adzic. I have probably read everything he's written by now and I think this book is one of the best he's put out there.

In the book Gojko gets a chance to use not only his fun and engaging writing style, but also his fascination for weird events and fun stories. He puts those two elements together to help us to appreciate the rare, annoying and down-right bizarre usages of our software. One of Gojko's earlier books was called Computers vs Humans and was *only* about stories where computer misusage, bugs and strangeness led to fun and even dangerous situations.

In Lizard Optimization, Gojko makes the claim that there is value in these unintended usage, strange bug reports and frustrated admin-users. They can actually guide us to pivot how our software can be used. By following-up on what the misconceptions or failures stemmed from we can find users with needs that have not yet been met.

Through a long array of real-life stories (with the battle scars to prove it) we get a lot of tools to tap into the unused potential of product development.

I can thoroughly recommend Lizard Optimization for anyone that have the need to find new potential value streams, user groups or even complete new products. Or just read it because it's a good read with lots of battle-hardened advice from an expert product developer.
