Ooooh - so nice. And so easy now when i know how to do it...


When you get large solutions and there are loads and loads of files in
the Solution Explorer you'll sometimes (often, in my case) get confused
on where you are...

I [organize my projects in Solution
Folders](http://marcushammarberg.blogspot.com/2006/11/well-structured-projects-in-visual.html)
but still get quite hard to follow, especially when you are the
codriver...

But it turns out to be easy to solve. There is a setting in the
Options-dialog of the Studio (both 2005 and 2008, luckily) that is
called Track Active item in Solution Explorer. When this is checked the
file you currently is watching is found and highlighted the Solution
Explorer which greatly reduces confusion on where you are.

The setting is found under Tools-\>Options-\>Project and
Solutions-\>General-\>Track Active item in Solution Explorer
