Yesterday was the second job of my "modelling career". You remember [the
first](http://www.marcusoft.net/2007/08/marcus-model_27.html) don't
you?

This time it was also for [<span>="blsp-spelling-error">Avega</span>](http://www.avega.se/) and for
a short interview in the annual report. Like the last time I felt really
confused about wearing make-up and doing poses. This time was in the
public also - at [<span>="blsp-spelling-error">Stureplan</span>](http://hitta.se/SearchCombi.aspx?vad=&var=stureplan%2c+stockholm)
downtown Stockholm. It was the same photographer - and he is great!

And, I have to say it don't I, the pictures are sure to be great. It
didn't feel cheap at all ;). I'll be sure to post some of them here as
soon as I am allowed.
