As part of my commitment to practicing what I preach, I've started transitioning more of my work into the cloud. After managing emails, contacts, and calendars online, it's time to move my files.

**[Dropbox](http://www.getdropbox.com)** has proven to be an excellent tool for this purpose. It offers a straightforward way to store files online and sync them across multiple devices. Additionally, Dropbox allows you to share specific folders or make files publicly available. For instance, you can find [some example code here](http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/2408484/Marcusoft.FluentAutomapper.zip).

With Dropbox, I no longer need to rely on USB drives—it's a seamless and convenient solution for file management. Highly recommended!
