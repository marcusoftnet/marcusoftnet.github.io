This is probably old news for many of you but today I had great use of the [Process Explorer](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx) tool.

With it you can get detailed information of all the processes running on the computer and the DLL's they are using. Also you can go the other way around; from a DLL find all processes that is using it.

We used it today to solve the age-old problem; "The file cannot be deleted because it being used by another process" - WHICH PROCESS?!!

Now you can solve that problem.

Oh yes - that's right; thank you Fredrik for this great tip!
