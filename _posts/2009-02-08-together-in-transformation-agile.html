<p>Today I did a presentation for the Salvation Army at a Hearing day that our Territoral Commander, Victor Poke has assembled. I was a bit confused at first but then I felt quite at easy with the whole thing since my topic suited me perfect. It was Together in Transformation. </p>  <p>Of course I couldn’t resist to preach the Agile gospel even for the Salvation Army. We are often quite rigid in our structures so that could be needed from time to time. </p>  <p>It was well recieved with a very rewarding discussion afterwards. It also felt very good for me to be able to put some quotes form the bible on a PowerPoint slide. Haven’t done that before. </p>
