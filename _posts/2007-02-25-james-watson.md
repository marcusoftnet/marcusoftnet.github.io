I had the great opportunity to play and rehearse under Mr James Watson. He is really a great guy and a great band instructor. We have had a very nice (but exhausting) four days with him and the concert on Friday night went quite alright (the band had some odd moments in Couldcatcher Fells).

Then on the Saturday morning we did a short but very rewarding rehearsal on the great Paganini Variations. The band has really been improving so that also went alright. It is within our reach i would say...
