had the great opportunity to play and rehearse
under Mr James Watson. He is really a
great guy and a great band instructor. We have had a very nice (but
exhausting) four days with him and the concert on Friday
night went quite alright (the band had some odd moments in Couldcatcher
Fells).

Then on the Saturday morning we did a short but very rewarding rehearsal
on the great Paganini Variations. The band has really been improving so
that also went alright. It is within our reach i would say...
