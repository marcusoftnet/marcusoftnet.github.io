I
bought the CD [Twenty supreme
years](http://www.4barsrest.com/shopping/cd_detail.asp?id=586) by
Eikanger-Bjørsvik a week ago. You will never be disappointed with
release from them. The playing is absolutely stunning and the
arrangements are great. Some really quirky music, but hey - who cares?

If you don't have it - get it now!

PS. When the cover is opened a friend of my can be seen playing the
horn, with mute. Way to go Trine.
