I'm working for [Tradera](http://www.tradera.com/) right now and as I've
[blogged about
before](http://www.marcusoft.net/2013/01/team-marketplace-how-we-splitted-big-40.html) we
have been splitting a big (40 people) team into smaller ones. Getting
this to continue to work and the teams to be effective has been my
challenging and very interesting task since then.

I can tell you that without great people that care - this would have
been a lot harder. With people that cares you can even allow yourselves
to try something, fail and change. That's great news for someone like
me - I fail a lot. And take great pride in doing so, as long as I learn
from it.

In this post I thought I'll describe a particular part of that process
that I have had problems getting to work many times; the daily team
sync, [Scrum of
Scrum](http://www.scrumalliance.org/articles/46-advice-on-conducting-the-scrum-of-scrums-meeting)
or Syncro whatever you call it. We call it Daily Sync.

### The problem



It's really quite simple really; you have several teams and you want
some sort of synchronization between them, share information or just
know what the others are up to. In our case we even had one big team
before, where everybody met every morning. The feeling of us knowing
exactly what was going on in every part of the system was very clear and
present. But did we really know everything?




Often you create a board or some place to gather information from all
teams. I personally think that it's a very good thing to visualize your
work there too (as I've [blogged about before, from another
project](http://www.marcusoft.net/2011/01/some-boards-in-my-current-project.html))
but that also froms questions about levels of details and double
bookkeeping.




I mean; in order to keep the big board interesting we want it to show
the right level of details but that's also reflected on each team board,
which in turn means that you need to have each work item represented
twice. And keep them synchronized.




You then have the meeting itself; **who** should come? **What** should
you talk about? Are you reporting (receiving) or are you deciding
(sending) **information**?




If the Daily Sync is going to be interesting you need to talk about
things that involve everybody in the meeting. Or at least things that
are interesting too them. We need to look out for not having all teams
restating what they just had said in their standup.




Speaking of that - **when** should the meeting be? It can be before or
after the daily standups in the teams, both options viable but giving us
different advantages. Before meant that we could decide stuff in the
Daily Sync and propagate that back to the teams, but we had a hard time
knowing the current status of the teams. If instead the teams have had
their daily before the Daily Sync we would have current team statuses
but it's harder to send information from Daily Sync that stand the risk
to become just a status meeting.  


### The reason



We went back to the root of the Daily Sync - what's the reason to have
such a meeting. The information about the team status is out there, in
each team, on their boards and the walls surrounding them. If not -
that's something we need and want to know that it's missing.




But there's an underlying thing here as well. When the group was one big
group we were used to hear the status of the entire group every
morning - now you need to go get it from the teams. It won't be fed to
you but you'll get it if you're interested.




We wanted the Daily Sync to have a purpose and be a meeting that is used
for something rather than just restating the information that already
been exchanged in the respectively teams. That meant that we focused the
Daily Sync on things that ... wait for it... needed to be synched
between the teams. And that only.


### Our solution ... s



This is our Daily Sync board as it looks today:

data-border="0" width="400" height="276" /></a>




For us focusing the Daily Sync means that we focus on three things every
morning:




- what is being released during the day - we have created a board with
    columns for "To Release", "Releasing", "Follow up" and finally
    "Done". The "Follow up"-column is used for things that we need to
    keep track on after we have released it.
- is there anything that's come up that fall ["between the
    chairs"](http://www.marcusoft.net/2013/03/between-chairs-management-and-thoughts.html).
    I've blogged about that in length before so I won't bore you with
    that here.  
- Any other important information that everybody needs to know? Here
    we can talk about a lot of different things; who is on "emergency
    call", which team is "emergency backup", there's cake at 15 today -
    anything you like. Most things that we talk about and decide are
    some how visualized on the board. You can see example of this on the
    board where we show important links, dates and the "Between the
    chairs"-square.



We're not:




- showing the work items that the individual teams have on their board
    on the big Daily Sync board. When they are about to release
    something the work item card is moved to the Daily Sync-board
- asking every team how things are going. We instead focus on the work
    and making sure that it flows quickly towards production.
- requiring metrics from the team on the progress. Not now at least...
    We have been playing with some easy way of tracking that but they
    haven't done us any good. So we stopped using them. One thing that
    has been remove since the picture was taken is the stop-lights (red,
    yellow and green). We thought that they could help us known how the
    teams were doing but we realized that we got to know which teams
    needed help anyhow so we have removed the stop-lights.  




Who attends the meeting:




- anyone that's interested - it's an open meeting
- every team needs to send one person that can accept or deny stuff
    into their backlog. This has to do with us discussing new stuff that
    potentially could be accepted into the team backlogs

### Conclusion





This is how we got the Daily Sync meetings to work for us; they are
short (usually under 10 minutes) and meaningful for everyone attending.




Oh yeah, almost forgot; they are most certainly not like this tomorrow.
They are not perfect and we change the content and form of them. Often.
The only thing that's certain is that we haven't perfected this. But
we're reaching there.
