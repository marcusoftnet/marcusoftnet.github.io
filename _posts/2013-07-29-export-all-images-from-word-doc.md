During the summer I was handed a delicate task for
<a href="http://bit.ly/theKanbanBook" target="_blank">the book</a>: "...
and also, if you could hand us all the images in the book, thank you
very much. Oh yeah, if you could name them CH01_01.png, CH01_02.png etc
it would be great."





Yes I felt a bit like:


<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">








Since Kanban In Action now have 13 chapters in different .doc-files I
immediately realized two things:




- Marcus - your are stupid for not tracking these images somewhere
- This is to big to do manually



This post describes how I did. It took me about 2 hours all together.



### Export all files in a Word document




The chapters are written in .doc formats (for some reason), but I seem
to recall that the newer format .docx in reality is just a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_(file_format)"
target="_blank">zip-file</a>. Maybe, just maybe, that could help me.




1. I "Save as..."'ed the file to .docx.
2. Then I renamed the file to .zip and extracted the archive to a
    folder.
3. Low and behold; in the \[Name of your word
    document\]/word/media-folder all the images were listed. In the
    order they appeared in the document.



The only downside, if you could call it that, was that the files were
named: image1.png, image2.png etc. That was the task up next:



### Renaming a lot of files (on OSX)



I now had all the files from all the documents, in separate folders.
That amounted to about 300 pictures. Yeah -
<a href="http://bit.ly/theKanbanBook" target="_blank">Kanban in
Action</a> is graphic-heavy!






300 pictures is way more than I care to rename by hand. Remember that
they wanted each file to be named <span
style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">\[chapter
number\]\_\[sequence number in chapter\].png. <span
style="font-family: inherit;">I then found <a
href="http://answers.oreilly.com/topic/2619-renaming-multiple-files-in-mac-os-x/"
target="_blank">this awesome video</a>Â that shows how to do that with
Automator.




<span style="font-family: inherit;">




<span style="font-family: inherit;">Here are the steps I ended up
using:




1. Start Automator
2. Choose New-\>Application
3. Search for "Rename Finder Items" and click OK
4. Select "Don't add" in the dialog that ask you if you want to create
    copies of the file. I didn't since I wanted to rename them
5. In the drop down select "Replace text" and do your replacement
    settings. Here are my example:
    <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

   <a
    href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-B2MKCS6z8U8/UfYsaPJa9_I/AAAAAAAABjs/0WLSFog_0ig/s1600/Screen+Shot+2013-07-29+at+10.48.11+.png"
    data-imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img
    src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-B2MKCS6z8U8/UfYsaPJa9_I/AAAAAAAABjs/0WLSFog_0ig/s320/Screen+Shot+2013-07-29+at+10.48.11+.png"
    data-border="0" width="320" height="142" /></a>
   </div>
6.  Save the application to a wellknown place, for example the desktop.



You have now created a little renamer application. To it you can drag
the files you want to rename and ... presto - they will be ranamed.
