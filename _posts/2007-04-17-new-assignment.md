Yesterday I started a new assignment. Still the insurance business
but a very different company. This is so big in comparison. The
IT-department has 150 employed developers to be compared with the three
person from the last place.

This also reflects in the administration, some of it is quite cool -
with some really impressive login-scripts and some is not so cool like
waiting for a day for admin rights on your computer. But all in all its
fun to do something new.

Soon the scary presentation will start... The butterflies has a
gathering in my stomach. A short prayer and knowing that I have prepared
will probably make them disappear...
