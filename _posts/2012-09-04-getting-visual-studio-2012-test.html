Yes, it's this is another "hey this is a cool feature of Visual Studio 2012" post. If you know all about the new Test Explorer and how to get NUnit, xUnit and by association&nbsp;<a href="http://www.specflow.org/" target="_blank">SpecFlow</a>&nbsp;to work with it - you can stop reading here. For me it took awhile to get up and running.<br /><br />I don't remember where I first read about it but I remember that I was happy to read that Visual Studio 2012 comes with a new <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh270865.aspx" target="_blank">Test Explorer</a>. What's really cool about it is that it's no longer limited to just&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSTest" target="_blank">MsTest</a>&nbsp;tests, but can run NUnit, xUnit ... you name it.<br /><br />This means that my SpecFlow tests can be run from the new Test Explorer as well. You know, all SpecFlow actually does is translating the <a href="https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki" target="_blank">Gherkin</a>&nbsp;lines you write into unit tests of your framework of choice. It should just work.<br /><br />So they said...<br /><br />Imagine my disappointment when the test explorer just reported "No unit tests found in solution" over and over again.<br /><br />So after awhile I picked up that you (of course!) need to install adapters for the unit test frameworks you want to have the Test explorer to pick up.<br /><br />That's quite easy. You go to Tools -&gt; Extensions and Updates and search the Visual Studio Gallery (you'll find it under the Online-tab in the dialog) for NUnit, xUnit or whatever framework your using. What you are looking for are Test adapters for Visual Studio 2012. Like these:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FX9dvj7RrdI/UEOyDE4vZxI/AAAAAAAABTM/lXpDG8swOPk/s1600/Screen+Shot+2012-09-02+at+21.18.46.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="176" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FX9dvj7RrdI/UEOyDE4vZxI/AAAAAAAABTM/lXpDG8swOPk/s320/Screen+Shot+2012-09-02+at+21.18.46.png" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">When that is installed I was again happy to see that Visual Studio picks up my SpecFlow specifications and I can run them from the test explorer.&nbsp;</div><h3>But wait, there is more</h3><div>When I started to use the Test Explorer I found a couple of nuggets in there too, for us SpecFlow-users:</div><div><ul><li>Double clicking&nbsp;a test takes you too... The specification and not the generated test. Thank you very much mr Hidden pragma (#line hidden)</li><li>You can run only failed, or passed for that matter and even a shortcut for rerunning the last test run. It seems like TDD&nbsp;practices&nbsp;are getting a firm footing at Microsoft...<br /><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-P1R_y4OI1us/UET6sootD2I/AAAAAAAABTg/vqkwYj0uxPo/s1600/Screen+Shot+2012-09-03+at+20.43.51.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="116" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-P1R_y4OI1us/UET6sootD2I/AAAAAAAABTg/vqkwYj0uxPo/s320/Screen+Shot+2012-09-03+at+20.43.51.png" width="320" /></a><br /></li><li>There is, from the Test menu, an option to rerun the tests on every build.
