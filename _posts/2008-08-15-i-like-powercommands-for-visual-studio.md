Just found these
<a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/PowerCommands"
id="ctl00_ctl00_WideContent_ProjectTitleControl1_ProjectTitleLink"
class="NoUnderline" tabindex="0">PowerCommands for Visual Studio
2008</a> , which looks very promising indeed. They are a collection of
nice-to-have-features in Visual Studio, that are missing from the
start.

My first two favorites are; Collapse projects in Solution and Copy and
Paste Project References. These two commands alone are worth the
download time...

It seems like not all of the commands is applicable for all languages,
like "Remove and sort using" that doesn't work in VB.NET (of course ;)),
but there are still usable stuff in there. Get one now!
