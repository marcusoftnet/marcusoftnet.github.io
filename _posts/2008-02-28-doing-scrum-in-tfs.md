I am
starting off a new project next week and we are going to run it as a
SCRUM project (of course, there is no other way now is there :)) .

Since our team is highly distributed we'll need some sort of support to
keep the SCRUM-heartbeat going. Let right now say that having
distributed team is not a choice of anyone in the project, that just how
it is and we'll have to live with it.

So Team Foundation Server is used at my customer and that is how we will
manage the project, code and documentation. We are also going to use the
[SCRUM-project-template from <span>="blsp-spelling-error">Conchango</span>](http://www.scrumforteamsystem.com/en/default.aspx).

However this is not good at all in my opinion. You force the team
members to update <span>="blsp-spelling-corrected">their</span> work in Team Explorer
before any Daily Scrum can be held, effective. For the team members that
will be just an other place to do time sheets - it wont be done!

Also the GUI (as <span>="blsp-spelling-corrected">I've</span> seen it) is not very good
for moving things around. It is not agile at all, if you get what i
mean. The easy "moving yellow stickers" methodology is <span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_3" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">completely</span>
out of the way and a "update your <span>="blsp-spelling-corrected">work items</span>. NOW!" - feeling is
there in its place.

However, there might be a way out of this. There is an [<span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_5"
class="blsp-spelling-error">EpiServer</span>](http://www.episerver.com/en/)
site-template that you can run <span>="blsp-spelling-corrected">on top</span> of the <span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_7" class="blsp-spelling-error">Conchango</span>
template with might, just might, be the solution. [Here it
is](http://www.codeplex.com/scrumdashboard).

It promises a lot (dashboard with AJAX-support) and if it replicates the
<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_8" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">brown
paper</span> and yellow stickers in a good way - we'll might be able to
pull this off. I'll keep you posted.

Keep your fingers crossed.
