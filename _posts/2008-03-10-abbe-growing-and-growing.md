Albert (or Abbe for short) is growing and in equal parts impressing and
driving us mad.

This morning we've got the first ever laugh (a very short burst of:
hehehe) which was very rewarding. We're not quite sure on what we did to
make him laugh but he has been in a excellent mood all weekend, so we'll
keep trying sounds and sights and see if the laugh can be lured out of
him again.

Above are some recent photos. I haven't been able to catch a smile yet -
but I am looking... watch this space
