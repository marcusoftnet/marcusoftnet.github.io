Yes, I know I’ve already written about an [online PowerPoint tool](http://www.marcusoft.net/2009/09/powerpoint-online-280-slides.html), but this new tool might just replace the need for both PowerPoint and similar software altogether.

I often find myself struggling with presentations that end up being dull and overly reliant on bullet points. While PowerPoint offers ways to enhance presentations, I sometimes find it lacking in creativity.

Enter [Prezi](http://prezi.com). Prezi allows you to create dynamic, visually engaging presentations that are more like interactive mind maps. It’s incredibly user-friendly and has helped me produce presentations that are visually appealing and engaging.

Check out my [first attempt](http://prezi.com/uzm8v1zdmxow/) which summarizes some key points from a Kanban class last week, as noted by [David Andersson](http://agilemanagement.net/). I think it turned out quite well!

Prezi might just be one of the coolest GUIs I’ve worked with—give it a try and see how it transforms your presentations.
