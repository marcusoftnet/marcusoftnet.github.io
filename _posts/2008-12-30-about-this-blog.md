Lately I have been asked the question why I have this blog, several
times actually. I honestly thought that I wrote that in [the first
posting I did](http://www.marcusoft.net/2006/10/marcus-on-net.html), but
it was very short. Not even when I change into
[www.marcusoft.net](http://www.marcusoft.net) I [wrote
something](http://www.marcusoft.net/2007/08/new-url-httpwwwmarcusoftnet.html)
about it.

But the reason for the blog is, and has always been this simple: I write
about things that interest me and when they catches my attention.
For several years I did notes in diffrent kind of notebooks at different
customers. Always forgot them when I left. So now I have them in one
place. I often link to the blog for solutions to problems I have and
solve.

I then and then write about private stuff also, in the same manner -
when it feels good.

I write in english to keep my english up to date.

So there you have - the reason for this blog and why I keep it.

PS.
The implications and "reach" of the blog has been way more than I ever
expected. I have around 700 visitiors (lost about 200 visits/month with
the [Avega
blog](http://blog.avegagroup.se/MarcusHammarberg/default.aspx)) each
month from all around the globe.
