So - here we are at the beginning of a new year. Prepare your
fingers of writing 08, 2008 and so on, i know that it will take me a
month or so to get use to it.

Here are a of the things i look forward to in 2008:

-   Of course - becoming a father. No - nothing yet. But soon!
-   Recording a CD with my band, the Vasa Band. The band has been
    working so hard for a long time now. It will be great to record it
    for real.
    Also i will be playing a solo on the CD which is a first for me. I
    will be playing my favorite solo in the Salvation Army literature
    "Journey into peace" by William Himes. That will also be great
-   Becoming a Sergent Major at the Vasa Corps. For the first time i
    really feel that a role suites me.
-   Rebuilding the Vasa Corps - from 28/12 2007 it's in progress. We are
    now rebuilding the corps. YEEES - it took about five years to come
    to a decision. Packing are in progress

These are just a few of the things i look forward to. I hope that your
year will be as exciting as mine is sure to be.

God bless you
