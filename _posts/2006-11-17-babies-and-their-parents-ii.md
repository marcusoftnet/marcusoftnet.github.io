When I wrote about [babies and their
parents](https://www.marcusoft.net/2006/11/babies-and-parents.html)
it caused a small stir here at the office, of course from the parents
here. Apparently babies _will_ take up all your spare time.

Anyhow - my friends, that was late pregnant, has now had a little girl.
We are going there tonight and I am really looking forward to meeting
them and her.

And also see if they still are the same people or if there has been
major changes to them -as it have to be according to my co-workers. I
won't promise to eat anything if not but I sure hope that its still my
old friends and not super-mum and dad.
