The Swedish brass band movement has a new champion... The king is dead - long live the king!

[Stockholm Brass Band](http://www.stockholmbrass.se/) is the new Swedish Brass band champions. And that's a real chocker for most of us. [WindCorp Brass Band](http://www.windcorpbrassband.se/) has been leagues before Stockholm when I've heard them but somehow the managed to nick the title from [WindCorp](http://www.windcorpbrassband.se/).

Don't get me wrong - [Stockholm](http://www.stockholmbrass.se/) is a great band with some truly amazing players (like [Håkan Björkman](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmJHK_y3NF4) for example). But [WindCorp](http://www.windcorpbrassband.se/) has loads of experience from many, many brass band competitions - something that there is not an abundance of in Stockholm.

My congratulations to Stockholm! Well deserved! And very impressive since the preparations has been surrounded with a lot sickness and problems to get a full band to rehearsals.
