The Swedish brass band movement has a new champion... The king is dead -
long live the king!

<a href="http://www.stockholmbrass.se/" target="_blank">Stockholm Brass
Band</a> is the new Swedish Brass band champions. And that's a real
chocker for most of us.
<a href="http://www.windcorpbrassband.se/" target="_blank">WindCorp
Brass Band</a> has been leagues before Stockholm when I've heard them
but somehow the managed to nick the title from
<a href="http://www.windcorpbrassband.se/" target="_blank">WindCorp</a>.

Don't get me wrong -
<a href="http://www.stockholmbrass.se/" target="_blank">Stockholm</a> is
a great band with some truly amazing players (like
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmJHK_y3NF4"
target="_blank">Håkan Björkman</a> for example). But
<a href="http://www.windcorpbrassband.se/" target="_blank">WindCorp</a>
has loads of experience from many, many brass band competitions -
something that there is not an abundance of in Stockholm.

My congratulations to Stockholm! Well deserved! And very impressive
since the preparations has been surrounded with a lot sickness and
problems to get a full band to rehearsals.
