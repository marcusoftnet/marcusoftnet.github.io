I’ve been involved and coached a project with several teams during the
last year. The project aims to convert a big (and important) core
business system from VB6 to the .NET platform.

It’s quite a big project with about 25-40 member (depending on which
phase it’s in) and so we have several different teams working in
parallel during the whole project. But it’s not until lately we’ve
created an board to show the status for the whole project. Mainly due to
high load in other areas of work, I have to admit.

This post will be a long one. But with lot of pictures so I hope you
wont be bored<img

### Project status board

In order to easily and effortless communicate the status of the complete
project we have created a board on the project level that captures the
status for each team. This is our first try to do this:

[<img
src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TI0jeIedRFk/TTlceE082mI/AAAAAAAAAvQ/wTEPt8PBzgE/project%20status%20board_thumb.jpg?imgmax=800"
title="project status board"
style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px"
data-border="0" width="420" height="262" alt="project status board" />](http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TI0jeIedRFk/TTlcdv_uioI/AAAAAAAAAvM/zg6S5XxNN7o/s1600-h/project%20status%20board%5B2%5D.jpg)

Note that we’ve started quite simple to only show the status, problems
and work in progress for each team. Later on you probably want to be
able to track resources to spot queues and bottlenecks building up
easier.

Here are some details on some of the visualizations we’ve used

### Status per team

[<img

title="status per team"
style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px"
data-border="0" width="243" height="357" alt="status per team" />](http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TI0jeIedRFk/TTlWAeEtggI/AAAAAAAAAt0/7SnuazNfZeg/s1600-h/status%20per%20team%5B2%5D.jpg)

Each team are communicating their status by the use of three
visualizations:

- A traffic light (Red, Green, Yellow) that answers the question; “Do
    we think that we will make our deadline?”
- To the far left they also show the number of items **left** in their
    respective backlog.
- For each team there’s also noted their deadlines and other important
    dates to work against.
- Finally on the right of the board there’s a section for any
    problems.

So with this there’s several ways to quickly get the status of the
project. The easiest is just to scan the traffic lights which gives you
an feel for how we’re doing.

### Other project level information visualized

We’ve also put up some other stuff to help people to understand the
board and our project.

An easy example of that is the key or legend that show how the traffic
light are to be interpret:

title="legend for the board"
style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px"
data-border="0" width="420" height="310" alt="legend for the board" />](http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TI0jeIedRFk/TTlWBW17rUI/AAAAAAAAAt8/sf_YDIXp8mE/s1600-h/legend%20for%20the%20board%5B2%5D.jpg)

Here you can see the project overall time schedule, the organization of
the project and other projects at the company that are dependent on us
(and deadlines for them):

We also have all the tools needed to add or change stuff nearby:

### Different teams, different backlogs, different methods

One really challenging part of when taking in a project with several
teams like this is that different teams work on different thing, in
different speed and with different methods.

This is manifested in “funny” (?) in the section showing the backlog
where the rows for each team right now says:

- Team 1 – 18/24 backlog items left
- Team 2 – 97/97 items left + 1/1 for an other little thing that
    doesn’t fit into their normal work (?)
- Team 3 – 6/8 items left. Each item takes about 4-8 weeks to complete
    though.
- Team 4 – 250 / 270 items to complete.
- Team 5 – No known backlog. This is a maintenance team that gets work
    through a mailbox. About 15 work items passed through their lane on
    the board each day.

So, as you probably can understand each team have chosen different
approaches. We have two Scrum project that uses sprints and well defined
backlogs for the sprint and for the whole “sub-project” (a.k.a. product
backlog for the team). Here are their boards:

data-border="0" width="420" height="285"
alt="scrum team 2 scrumboard" />](http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TI0jeIedRFk/TTlWE0bmxiI/AAAAAAAAAuc/CDKZAmeCWJo/s1600-h/scrum%20team%202%20scrumboard%5B2%5D.jpg)

### Phases for cross cutting concerns conversions

And we have a development team that converts a big VB6 client GUI to
.NET. They work in phases for about 1-2 month each. There is no easy way
to visualize their work since they are tackling crosscutting concerns
through the complete system. For example:

- create and implement a new data access strategy through the whole
    system
- remove all the Visual Basic 6 references that still is left in the
    converted code.

The complete backlog is just a couple of items. But they have to be done
through a complete system. Here is the backlog (as it looks now):

[<img
src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TI0jeIedRFk/TTp8AOjSWUI/AAAAAAAAAvg/4kBNTmWS_gA/dev%20team%20backlog_thumb.jpg?imgmax=800"
title="dev team backlog"
style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px"
data-border="0" width="387" height="357" alt="dev team backlog" />](http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TI0jeIedRFk/TTp7_uWN5XI/AAAAAAAAAvc/exSE699CLgs/s1600-h/dev%20team%20backlog%5B2%5D.jpg)

So instead we listed all the forms from VB6 (270 forms!) and estimated
them in S, M, L and XL. We could the create an excel sheet that shows
our progress as we go through all the code in each phase. Here’s an
example of the excel sheet from a late stage in the current phase:

[<img
src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TI0jeIedRFk/TTlWHWDsBFI/AAAAAAAAAuw/Msrtgrs07iw/dev%20team%20status_thumb.jpg?imgmax=800"
title="dev team status"
style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px"
data-border="0" width="420" height="247" alt="dev team status" />](http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TI0jeIedRFk/TTlWHGN-vSI/AAAAAAAAAus/FM9tNP8fjAE/s1600-h/dev%20team%20status%5B2%5D.jpg)

With this in place we could even show how “badly” we estimated in the
outset. But I’ve <a
href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2010/11/emperor-is-naked-planning-in-advance-is.html"
target="_blank">already written about that</a>.

### Test a phase oriented development team

To test this we have aimed to write automated test using
<a href="http://www.specflow.org" target="_blank">SpecFlow</a> and White
(<a
href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2010/08/using-bdd-with-specflow-wpf-and-white_14.html"
target="_blank">see this</a> (and yes this is NOT
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_Driven_Development"
target="_blank">BDD</a> but it’s a great way to get business readable
automated test scripts)). Their challenge was that the code they are
testing (from the GUI Dev team) changes. A lot. And often. So we HAD to
automate the test. Also no-one tester are full time in the project. They
all have other tasks as well.

So the backlog is simply a list of all the features of the system
(here’s a part):

[<img

title="test team backlog"
style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px"
data-border="0" width="243" height="357" alt="test team backlog" />](http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TI0jeIedRFk/TTlWH5dy5sI/AAAAAAAAAu0/Y0y2ZCQ285I/s1600-h/test%20team%20backlog%5B2%5D.jpg)

And the board is a Kanban board using many visualizations:

[<img

title="test team kanbanboard"
style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px"
data-border="0" width="420" height="285" alt="test team kanbanboard" />](http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TI0jeIedRFk/TTlWJTOtiVI/AAAAAAAAAu8/0-cvvPlWuYc/s1600-h/test%20team%20kanbanboard%5B2%5D.jpg)

Note the exit criteria at the bottom that sets the expectations or
definition of done for each stage. They have also proven to be a great
support for people to remember what to do next.

### Conclusion

With this post I wanted to show some of the way we have used different
visualizations in our project. I’ve learned a lot by it and especially
the power of just putting up stuff on the wall. If you can’t see your
work probably no-one else will either.
