<p>It’s been a while since I did some code on the project. Abbe has been quite sickly and I have not had the time. No worries – it’s all a hobby ;)</p>  <p>OK – what I have done since last time (2 x 15 min I think) is to produce a list of Product on my web page. With this fancy layout… </p>  <p><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_kkDJOSPNTLs/SaCAjQSVUTI/AAAAAAAAAho/OLO2yJ2vMTw/s1600-h/sprintplannerhelpergui1%5B3%5D.jpg"><img title="sprintplannerhelpergui1" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="212" alt="sprintplannerhelpergui1" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_kkDJOSPNTLs/SaCAj6mqXeI/AAAAAAAAAhs/q5kHDnspv6E/sprintplannerhelpergui1_thumb%5B1%5D.jpg?imgmax=800" width="386" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>That made me realize that I could have added some disclaimer when it comes to the UI. I made a certain css-class for the productlist, so someone can help me out later. I will make it functional now – not pretty. </p>  <p>I also came to realize that my model may be enhanced with some status for the product items and aggregated values for how much that is done for a product. I TDD’ed them out and added them to the GUI. Which took me forever since I got stuck on LINQ-issues. Here is a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcsharp/aa336746.aspx">excellent site</a> for help in these matters.</p>
