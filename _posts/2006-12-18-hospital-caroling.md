When I wrote
the list over [weird things to do this
weekend](http://marcushammarberg.blogspot.com/2006/12/strange-thing-on-agenda.html)
i forgot the most heartwarming thing; yesterday i went to the St GÃ¶rans
Hospital with Elin and a friend. Elins father works there as a hospital
priest. We went around about 5 floors and sung carols and some
euphoniumplaying sneaked it's way in there too :)

It was very rewarding although not too many people had the strength to
come out - which you can understand. But I could almost feel their
appreciation out the place where we stood.
