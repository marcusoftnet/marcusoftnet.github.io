<p>During my ventures in to new Microsoft land I’ve stumbled on the concept of scaffolding (in the form of the excellent <a href="http://blog.stevensanderson.com/2011/01/13/scaffold-your-aspnet-mvc-3-project-with-the-mvcscaffolding-package/" target="_blank">MvcScaffolding</a>). The concept is well known in other frameworks and one of the <a href="http://media.rubyonrails.org/video/rails_take2_with_sound.mov" target="_blank">eye-opener features of for example Ruby on Rails</a>. </p> <p>But as I <a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/search/label/KanbanBoards" target="_blank">started to use scaffolding</a> I had to stop and think for a while on other values that I have come to hold in high respect such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development" target="_blank">TDD</a> for example. The whole concept of <a href="http://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com/" target="_blank">driving out my code guided by test</a> has completely changed the way I code. And my code!.</p> <p>I don’t feel very good about myself, nowadays, if I have to write code without tests. But this scaffolded code is not code I have written. Should I write test for it? Before the code is generated or afterwards.</p> <p>Since <a href="http://www.google.se/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=tdd+scaffolding#sclient=psy&amp;hl=sv&amp;source=hp&amp;q=tdd+scaffold&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;pbx=1&amp;fp=8279ccb541c59dbd" target="_blank">I couldn’t find to much about it</a> I though I jot down some thoughts on the subject. I think that it’s something that will be used more and more in the Microsoft sphere.</p><a name='more'></a> <h3>Definition</h3> <p>On <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaffolding" target="_blank">Wikipedia scaffolding is defined as</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p><b>Scaffolding</b> is a temporary structure used to support people and material in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction">construction</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repair">repair</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buildings">buildings</a> and other large structures.</p></blockquote> <p>And if you try to find a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaffold_(programming)" target="_blank">definition for programming</a> you’ll end up with something like:</p> <blockquote> <p><b>Scaffolding</b> is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-programming">meta-programming</a> method of building <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a>-backend <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_application">software applications</a>. It is a technique supported by some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller">model-view-controller</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework">frameworks</a>, in which the programmer may write a specification that describes how the application database may be used. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler">compiler</a> uses this specification to generate code that the application can use to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">create, read, update and delete</a> database entries, effectively treating the template as a "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaffolding">scaffold</a>" on which to build a more powerful application.</p></blockquote> <p>Comparing these definitions I think that a key difference between them are the “temporary” word and principle. A scaffold to raise a building is supposed to be removed as the building is finished. The scaffolded code we get, from a scaffolder, is supposed to be a guide and supposed to be built into the core of our application. </p> <p>As <a href="http://blog.stevensanderson.com/2011/01/13/scaffold-your-aspnet-mvc-3-project-with-the-mvcscaffolding-package/" target="_blank">Steven Sanderson writes</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>“Scaffolding” is used by many software technologies to mean “quickly generating a basic outline of your software that you can then edit and customize”</p></blockquote> <p>We’re supposed to change it. It’s just some code to get up us and running. In the case of MvcScaffolding (and I think the scaffolded code of Ruby on Rails) you actually get fully working code, structured in a tried and tested way with templated views. </p> <h3>TDD</h3> <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development#Benefits" target="_blank">Test Driven Development is a way to produce great code</a>. It makes me think about what is needed and how I am going to use it – before I write the production code. It helps me to flesh out dependencies and structure even before the code is produced. And I don’t write stuff I don’t need – <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_ain't_gonna_need_it" target="_blank">YAGNI</a>.</p> <p>Oh yeah – as a funny side effect I get a test that will tell me if any of my changes down the road will break existing code (or tests.)</p> <p>All this is great but here (with a scaffolder)&nbsp; I get a bunch of code generated without writing a single test.</p> <h3>So what is it?</h3> <p>First – I think that code generation (as scaffolding ultimate is) is a great idea. To generate code that you don’t want to write over and over, in a well defined manner. Great idea!</p> <p>But what kind of animal is the generated code. Is it my code? I haven’t written it. A tool has. I might or might now have control over what is being generated. </p> <p>So it’s someone else's code? Well not really. It’s generated for me but it’s still code. Not compiled assemblies that I include. I am <strong>supposed</strong> to change it. </p> <p>And herein lies the problem (for me at least); the code is a bit tricky to classify and handle. </p> <ul> <li>If it is my code I sure want a way to test it. Especially if I am going to do changes in it later on. Otherwise the Red light will not shine when I mess the code up later. <br>Actually I would like to have the test code scaffolded in the same way as the production code – “tests to get me going”.  <li>If it’s not my code I don’t want to see it. I don’t care how <a href="http://code.google.com/p/elmah/" target="_blank">ELMAH</a>, <a href="http://unity.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">Unity</a> or <a href="http://www.nhforge.org" target="_blank">NHibernate</a> are constructed internally. Or at least I don’t want to.&nbsp; </li></ul> <p>I suppose that the code could be a mix of those two but in reality I can’t see how to draw that line. This is either is my code (in which case I want the code to be tested) or not (in which case I hope it’s test but I really don’t care as long as it works).</p> <h3>What to do?</h3> <p>The first thing is to decide on how to treat the code; mine or not. And then face the facts from that decision. </p> <p>If you treat the code as your own tests should be added. Most tools (MvcScaffolding for examples) use a templates that can be tweaked into the code you want. I would suggest that you tweak the templates to generate tests for the code that is generated. </p> <p>In my current project I’ve written a tool that generate data access code (for the 1200 stored procedures we’re going to call – phew!) and here I opted to generate tests as well. The code is also supposed to change over time I wanted the team to have a way to trap any errors down the road. Also since I wrote the template with TDD that came very cheap to me.&nbsp; </p> <p>If you treat the code as theirs, as a third party tools that you happen to generate, I would suggest to tweak the code to reflect that. You can use the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.debuggernonusercodeattribute.aspx" target="_blank">DebuggerNonUserCode-attribute</a> in .NET to do that. Maybe in conjunction with the Auto-Generated comment (&lt;auto-generated&gt;) like, <a href="https://github.com/techtalk/SpecFlow/blob/master/Tests/FeatureTests/BeforeAfterHooks/BeforeAfterHooks.feature.cs" target="_blank">for example in this code file.</a></p> <h3>Conclusion</h3> <p>OK – there you have some thoughts that have been flying around in my mind a couple of days. Would love to hear any comments on the subject. I might very well be so that I’ve missed recommendations on the subject – please correct me then. Otherwise I’ll run with this think for a while. </p>
