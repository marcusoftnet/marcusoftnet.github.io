<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">The last couple of days I have enjoyed the speed and easy-going-flow that <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Node</a>, <a href="http://koajs.com/" target="_blank">KoaJs</a> and <a href="http://www.heroku.com/" target="_blank">Herkou</a> gives me. It's truly blows me away and I have been tweeting stuff like:<br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">Once <a href="https://twitter.com/heroku">@heroku</a> tool belt is set up the first time deployment is SILLY simple. I’m talking 20 seconds, including <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23mongodb&amp;src=hash">#mongodb</a> provisioning <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23amazed&amp;src=hash">#amazed</a><br />— Marcus Hammarberg (@marcusoftnet) <a href="https://twitter.com/marcusoftnet/statuses/479243915606781954">June 18, 2014</a></blockquote>and<br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">Again: From idea (we should put this into prod now) to complete: 25 min. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23koaJs&amp;src=hash">#koaJs</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23heroku&amp;src=hash">#heroku</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23nodejs&amp;src=hash">#nodejs</a> Like last time: <a href="http://t.co/GSvpuV4xsA">http://t.co/GSvpuV4xsA</a><br />— Marcus Hammarberg (@marcusoftnet) <a href="https://twitter.com/marcusoftnet/statuses/479247826224832513">June 18, 2014</a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script> But... In one regard I have lied. I told <a href="https://twitter.com/WoodyZuill" target="_blank">Woody Zuill</a> (friend and role model) that I could push to production with a single command. While that was true the command (<span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">git push heroku master</span>) did just that. Push to Heroku. But I wanted it to test my code, version it, push to GitHub and then push to Heroku. You know - all the continuous delivery stuff.<br /><br />I had to look into the "scary" domain of Makefiles. Untravelled territory for me. I thought it was scary but it was just a bit weird and I actually got something nice to work.<br /><br />This post described what I did - and how I redeemed my statement to Woody so that deploying to production is in fact one command (about 25 seconds).<br /><a name='more'></a>The Makefile I created took inspiration from <a href="https://github.com/visionmedia/co-monk" target="_blank">VisionMedia's in co-monk</a>&nbsp;and this <a href="http://andreypopp.com/posts/2013-05-16-makefile-recipes-for-node-js.html" target="_blank">article</a>. And<a href="http://chrisadams.me.uk/2012/10/21/understanding-make/" target="_blank"> I read this to sort out some quirks</a>, like .PHONY and one-liners (for the record... both of those are really strange - get to know them).<br /><br />With the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)" target="_blank"><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">make</span> utility</a>, found on LINUX and OS X systems you can very easily define tasks and then chain them together to form more advanced commands. For example this creates a task named <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">test</span> that runs <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">mocha</span> with a lot of flags that I couldn't care less of typing.<br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/marcusoftnet/93798813e89f9fead741.js"></script><br />Ok, you say. I can do that with package.json and npm too - <a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2014/02/mnb-packagejson.html" target="_blank">picked it up from you blog actually</a>.<br /><br />Well, there are something that you wouldn't want to, or just can't do inside a simple package.json script. For example, here's a task (that I've ripped <a href="http://andreypopp.com/posts/2013-05-16-makefile-recipes-for-node-js.html" target="_blank">right off from here</a>) that increments the version number, updates the package.json file and then commits those changes to git.<br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/marcusoftnet/4be33a74987d54285607.js"></script><br />It looks horrendous but it's basically executing a string of node code to update the package.json and then just use ordinary git bash commands to tag with the version number.<br />Oh, I ran into problems with this task since it's actually using a <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/semver" target="_blank">NPM package called semver</a>. Nothing strange with the package but it of course needs to be installed in your node_modules-folder. Preferably you do that with:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">npm install semver --save-dev</span></blockquote>This stores the semver dependency in your package.json as a development time dependency. Which is exactly as it should be.<br /><br />I then created a couple of other small tasks with finally made me write the <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">deployProd</span>&nbsp;task. The task does the following:<br /><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>runs my tests</li><li>use the release-function defined above to create a new minor (0.X.0) release</li><li>commits and tag that in git</li><li>push to github</li><li>push to heroku</li><li>launches the site in my browser for verification</li></ul><div>(This could be preceded by a build task if you're minimising, transforming your code from CoffeeScript or TypeScript, or doing some other mangling of the code.)<br /><br />And thanks to <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">make</span>'s built in-features the command halts if anything didn't worked as expected, the test failed for example.<br /><br />The task code? Well it's almost just reading the list above out loud.</div><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">deployProd: test createMinorRelease pushGithub pushHeroku launch</span></blockquote>Here's the entire makefile.<br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/marcusoftnet/9111f3454fdfdadccba6.js"></script><br />There! I'm not lying to Woody anymore. Feels great. For more than just that reason. Because now I truly have 1 single command to deploy my application properly.&nbsp;</div>
