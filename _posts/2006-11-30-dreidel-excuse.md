Just noticed that after the Dreidel-song there were some people
exposing themselves before the camera on the top list.

The Dreidel-video was from another site called myspace.com and after the
video had run to the end a list of the most watched videos was shown.
Apparently some of the top videos for people to watch were some other
people taking their clothes off.

I have now removed the file. Sorry about that.
