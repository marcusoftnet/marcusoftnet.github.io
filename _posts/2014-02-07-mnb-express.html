<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I'm writing down some of the things I've picked up when I started to learn about&nbsp;<a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Node</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://expressjs.com/" target="_blank">Express</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mongodb.org/" target="_blank">Mongo</a>.

Pretty soon though you want something that is a bit friendlier to code against. Most people seems to go with&nbsp;<a href="http://expressjs.com/" target="_blank">Express</a>. From their web page we read:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Express is a minimal and flexible node.js web application framework, providing a robust set of features for building single and multi-page, and hybrid web applications.</blockquote>Couldn't agree more. The only thing is... most tutorials on Express uses the generators. That is the set of tools that comes with Express (install with <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">npm install express -g) </span><span style="font-family: inherit;">and you'll have the generators all over. This site generator bothers me in two ways:</span><br /><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>it sets up a complete site, when I just want to do an API</li><li>that site defaults to server-side generation, when I want to serve a static JavaScript client</li></ul><div>Nowadays I tend to default to a simple backend API (see, I din't even write REST API just to avoid religious battles. Smooth operator :)), that just serve JSON and then a Javascript client that calls into that API, using <a href="http://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJS</a> for example.&nbsp;</div><div>I don't need Jade, Sessions and folders for controllers etc. My whole API will be 1-5 files depending on how modular I'm feeling. I might need a public folder but that's easy enough to fix.</div><div><br /></div><div>So my suggestion is that you ditch the <a href="http://expressjs.com/guide.html#executable" target="_blank">generators (powerful as they are)</a>&nbsp;and drop down to bare-bones&nbsp;<a href="http://expressjs.com/" target="_blank">Express</a>.&nbsp;You'll find a very powerful and terse framework that resembles <a href="http://nancyfx.org/" target="_blank">NancyFx </a>a lot. Ah, well it resembles <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/" target="_blank">Sinatra </a>too, but Nancy is cooler.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>In fact, on their&nbsp;<a href="http://expressjs.com/guide.html#executable" target="_blank">guide-page</a>,<a href="http://expressjs.com/" target="_blank"> ExpressJs</a> is showing you the minimal version first. And we can write the ubiquitous fit-in-a-tweet-web application:</div><script src="https://gist.github.com/marcusoftnet/8797870.js"></script> <br /><div><div style="text-align: left;">This little application just responds with "Hello World" when you access it on <a href="http://localhost:3000/">http://localhost:3000</a></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Understanding Express</h3><div>The API for Express is very easy and in fact there just a couple of basic things that you need to know in order to start coding up an API. Things are considerable easier when we're just dishing out JSON rather than keeping creating a complete site.<br /><br />As always this is just the things that I've used and get to know. You should check out the<a href="http://expressjs.com/api.html" target="_blank"> API documentation</a>, it's great. And the <a href="http://expressjs.com/guide.html" target="_blank">starting guide</a> is also nice.<br /><br /></div><div>First and formost you should create an Express application. This is super simple since that's what the <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">express()</span> function returns. Like this:<br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/marcusoftnet/8803256.js"></script>In the little tweet example above you saw the app.get() function in action. The really good news is that all the HTTP verbs act in the same manner. They take an URL path and a callback function.&nbsp;</div><script src="https://gist.github.com/marcusoftnet/8803385.js"></script> <br /><div>You can understand it as: "when somebody <i>Posts</i> to '/orders/', execute this function that I'm writing here".</div><div><br /></div><div>As I said the path parameter can contain parameters that we easily get hold of via the <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;"><a href="http://expressjs.com/api.html#req.params" target="_blank">req.params</a> </span><span style="font-family: inherit;">property</span>. Here's an example of a get to an URL with a parameter, called id</div><script src="https://gist.github.com/marcusoftnet/8803551.js"></script> <br /><div>Often your clients will be sending data in the body of the HTTP request. Express provides an easy way to extract those by using the middleware <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;"><a href="http://expressjs.com/api.html#req.body" target="_blank">bodyParser()</a></span> (see below). Which gives us this easy way to access the body data</div><script src="https://gist.github.com/marcusoftnet/8803723.js"></script>To this you can post a HTTP form like this (using the awesome <a href="http://www.getpostman.com/" target="_blank">Postman extension for Chrome</a>):<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1qNQ7SOosMg/UvDtzj8PjNI/AAAAAAAAB7M/gk0bNXl-_E8/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-02-04+at+20.38.36+.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1qNQ7SOosMg/UvDtzj8PjNI/AAAAAAAAB7M/gk0bNXl-_E8/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-02-04+at+20.38.36+.png" height="328" width="640" /></a></div><br /></div><div>Sometimes, or rather after awhile, writing the functions inline gets a bit messy. You can then write the handling code in a separate module and include that. Express, default, puts these in a folder called "routes", but we can do as we want.</div><script src="https://gist.github.com/marcusoftnet/8803839.js"></script> <br /><div>Note that I'm using the <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">exports</span>-keyword in the <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">userHandler.js</span> file. That let's the function be visible to other modules. I used the name&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">handler</span> as a nod to a way we created frameworks in the 90-ies. Everything that we really didn't know what to name was "handler". It should maybe have been "controller" in this case...</div><div>You return data via the response-object that is passed to the callback function for your route, often called <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">res </span>but you can of course name it what ever you want. The simplest is just to do send as we seen a lot of examples of already.<br /><br /></div><div>When you send JSON back there's a special method for that. The content-type will automatically be set to "application/json" for you when using this method as a nice little service to you.&nbsp;</div><script src="https://gist.github.com/marcusoftnet/8803960.js"></script> <br /><h3 style="text-align: left;">Middleware</h3><div>At the heart of Express is the Connect middleware. For the most part you don't need to care about Connect since it's nicely exposed as a couple of functions, but it's really how Express is stitched together.<br /><br />We have already seen the&nbsp;<a href="http://expressjs.com/api.html#req.body" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;" target="_blank">bodyParser()</a>&nbsp;in action and here are few others that I found useful:<br /><h4 style="text-align: left;">basicAuth</h4><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;"><a href="http://expressjs.com/api.html#basicAuth" target="_blank">basicAuth()</a></span>- sets up basic authentication for your site. As always, basic is sending the username and password in clear text, so beware.</div><script src="https://gist.github.com/marcusoftnet/8806063.js"></script> <br /><h4 style="text-align: left;">directory and static</h4><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;"><a href="http://expressjs.com/api.html#directory" target="_blank">directory()</a></span> - that helps you configure directories, together with <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">static()</span> it can help you to serve up static files; like your client side JavaScript application for example</div><script src="https://gist.github.com/marcusoftnet/8806245.js"></script> <br /><h4 style="text-align: left;">app.param() - an example of middleware, that is really powerful</h4><div>The one middleware that impressed me the most, so far, is <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;"><a href="http://expressjs.com/api.html#app.param" target="_blank">app.param()</a></span>. This can help you do some really powerful stuff, in just a few lines of code. To show this I'm going to <a href="http://webapplog.com/tutorial-node-js-and-mongodb-json-rest-api-server-with-mongoskin-and-express-js/" target="_blank">lean on an example from this site </a>and walk your through it:</div><script src="https://gist.github.com/marcusoftnet/8815227.js"></script> <br /><div>You could also do hard coded paths, of course (like /users) and create a little snippet that loads users by id. This is shown to great effect in the documentation for&nbsp;<a href="http://expressjs.com/api.html#app.param" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;" target="_blank">app.param()</a>&nbsp;and I've adapted it here:<br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/marcusoftnet/8815698.js"></script> <br /><h3 style="text-align: left;">Conclusion</h3>Yeah, as you can see express is not that hard and that the same time powerful. Just like we like it. I think you get the know the framework much better without the generators. Go old school and type it yourself!</div></div>
