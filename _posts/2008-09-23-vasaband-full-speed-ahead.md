The
band I am playing in - the [<span>="blsp-spelling-error">Vasa</span>
band](http://www.vasaband.com/) - is right now in a great form, great
spirit and on full speed ahead;


-   Last Sunday we did a concert in [<span>Sundbyberg</span>](http://www.hitta.se/LargeMap.aspx?var=Sundbyberg) -
    first for the season. It went very well and was good received.
-   Our website - [www.vasaband.se](http://www.vasaband.se/) (or
    [www.vasaband.com](http://www.vasaband.com/)) - is soon to be
    launched. It looks great I think. Great work Samuel!
-   We are in the last preparations for our new [CD -
    Priority](http://www.vasaband.se/wm07.php)
-   On Wednesday the 8 October 19.30 there will be a release party on
    <span>Centrumkåren</span>, [<span
    id="SPELLING_ERROR_3"
    class="blsp-spelling-error">Drottningatan</span>
    66](http://www.hitta.se/LargeMap.aspx?var=Drottningatan+66+stockholm)
-   Two days later we will be heading out on a tour to promote the CD.
    The tour will take us to [<span>Lidköping</span>](http://www.hitta.se/LargeMap.aspx?var=lidk%f6ping),
    [<span>Göteborg</span>](http://www.hitta.se/LargeMap.aspx?var=g%f6teborg)
    and [<span>Jönköping</span>](http://www.hitta.se/LargeMap.aspx?var=j%f6nk%f6ping).
-   The season will end with a Christmas concert.

Lot's of stuff but I love every minute of it. I wouldn't want to do this
with no others!

Let's go!
