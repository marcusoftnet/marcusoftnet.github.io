When <a href="http://joakimsunden.com">Joakim</a> and I wrote the book we had a chapter on measurement in it, chapter 11 - "Using metrics to guide improvements". It was intended to show a few ways that metrics can be used in a flow-based process that uses kanban for improvements. 

When we wrote it I happened to show it to <a href="https://twitter.com/drunkcod">Torbj√∂rn Gyllebring</a> that is very sincere in his criticism. His first words:
<blockquote>You can't write a word about measurements if you haven't read "How to measure anything"</blockquote>

When you have not read that book and writing a lot of words on measurements... hearing that has a bit of a "DOH!"-effect on you and your writing. But Joakim had and that made me feel a little better. I was largely satisfied with the chapter too. 

But now I have read it and I wanted to share some of the main points that I've picked up from this great book.
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Measure-Anything-Intangibles-Business/dp/0470539399">How to Measure Anything: Finding the Value of Intangibles in Business</a> is the name and link for the book. It's an awesome read and I recommend anyone to read it.

This is not a review per se but rather three points that I've picked up from the book and that already now have helped me immensely.
