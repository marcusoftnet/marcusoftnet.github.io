OK - in order to be able to work with this at all I thought I first
should do some administrative stuff for the project. So I have setup a
<a href="http://www.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">CodePlex</a>-project
where I will keep my sources. You'll find it at:
<http://www.codeplex.com/sprintplannerhelper/>. You can apply for
getting part of the project there in order to get hold of the sources as
I move along.

During the setup-process of that I learned that the Team Explorer Client
that is used to connect to a TFS Server is actually free (!). You can
download it from <a
href="http://www.codeplex.com/CodePlex/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Obtaining%20the%20Team%20Explorer%20Client"
target="_blank">here</a>.

I also decided to keep it quite freeware-ish. I will not use any
products that cost money. In order for any other to "reproduce" the
project on their computers.

OK - the project will soon be up - kind of. I have just created the
solution and added my <a
href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2009/01/what-to-do-now-sprint-planner-helper.html"
target="_blank">product backlog.</a> Next thing on the agenda will be to
create the projects.

PS
I also downloaded the <a
href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2009/01/27/asp-net-mvc-1-0-release-candidate-now-available.aspx"
target="_blank">release candidate for the ASP.NET MVC</a> which contains
some nice features such as better integration in Visual Studio.
