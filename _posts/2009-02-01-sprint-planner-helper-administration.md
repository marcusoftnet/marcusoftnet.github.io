OK - to get started with this project, I first needed to handle some administrative tasks. I've set up a [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com/) project where I will keep the source code. You can find it here: [Sprint Planner Helper on CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com/sprintplannerhelper/). You can apply for access to the project to get hold of the sources as they become available.

During the setup, I discovered that the Team Explorer Client used to connect to a TFS Server is actually free! You can download it [here](http://www.codeplex.com/CodePlex/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Obtaining%20the%20Team%20Explorer%20Client).

I also decided to keep the project completely freeware. I will avoid using any paid products to ensure that anyone can reproduce the project on their own machines.

The project is coming along. I’ve created the solution and added my [product backlog](https://www.marcusoft.net/2009/01/what-to-do-now-sprint-planner-helper.html). Next, I’ll be working on setting up the projects.

**P.S.**
I also downloaded the [ASP.NET MVC 1.0 release candidate](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2009/01/27/asp-net-mvc-1-0-release-candidate-now-available.aspx), which includes some nice features such as improved integration with Visual Studio.
