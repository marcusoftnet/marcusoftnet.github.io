OK - my first parental leave day is well on the way. You should try
this - it's great!

I thought that I would upload some photos of Albert as the time progress
to see how he is developed. Here is one from a few days back.

Right now he'll walk if I hold his hands, and he talks a lot with two
words: Pappa and Albert.
