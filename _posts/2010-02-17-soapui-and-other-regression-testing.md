I been looking around for some way of (regression)testing the WCF
service we will build in my current project. I will not write another
client and be forced to maintain it during the project. This took loads
of time the last time I tried it.
The thing I will settle on is
<a href="http://soapui.org/" target="_blank">SOAPUi</a>, which seems
just awesome. I have already <a
href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2008/12/soap-ui-great-way-to-do-integration.html"
target="_blank">written about it</a> – but didn’t get the time to try it
for real. I sure will now!
But there are others – many of the free. Just
<a href="http://storm.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">see</a> for
<a href="http://soamoa.org/" target="_blank">yourself</a>.
A nice complement is
<a href="http://www.wsdldisco.com/" target="_blank">WSDLDisco</a> that
creates a portal for your services. This is a way to open up for ad-hoc
testing for project members that not is comfortable with XML or concepts
as requests/responses.
