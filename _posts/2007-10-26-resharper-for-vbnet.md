Oh my
god - the worlds most well known and loved refactoring
tool [Resharper](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/),
now contains support for
[VB.NET](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/features/newfeatures.html#vbImprovements).

Hopefully this will solve the limbo that Microsoft has left us VB.NET
developers in...

I'll get back with an "review" shortly...

I'm back - and the answere is NO! I'm sorry but the Add-In has crasched
with unhandled exception six times in an hour. As we say in the Swedish
military - REDO - DO RIGHT.

I am uninstalling it as we speak. Nice try though - seemed to promise a
lot.
