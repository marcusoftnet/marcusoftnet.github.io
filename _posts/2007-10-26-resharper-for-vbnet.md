Oh my god - the worlds most well known and loved refactoring tool [Resharper](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/), now contains support for [VB.NET](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/features/newfeatures.html#vbImprovements).

Hopefully this will solve the limbo that Microsoft has left us VB.NET developers in...

I'll get back with an "review" shortly...

I'm back - and the answer is NO! I'm sorry but the Add-In has crashed with unhandled exception six times in an hour. As we say in the Swedish military - REDO - DO RIGHT.

I am uninstalling it as we speak. Nice try though - seemed to promise a lot.
