This is the final post in my series on the problem that a lot of people
sees meetings as not being real work. I think this has to do with the
meetings being bad and badly conducted. So we need to improve on the
quality of the meetings to make them more interesting feel worthwhile.

In these blog posts (<a
href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2012/09/applying-switch-framework-to-meetings.html"
target="_blank">I</a> and <a
href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2012/09/applying-switch-framework-to-meetings_20.html"
target="_blank">II</a>) I have applied the <a
href="http://www.heathbrothers.com/resources/download/switch-framework.pdf"
target="_blank">Switch Framework</a> on how to make meetings better and
more interesting to attend.

In the previous two posts we've talked about reasoning with the Rider
(our logical side) and tried to get the Elephant (our lazy, subconsious
part) over to our side. In this post we're trying to smooth the path
that they are walking down to make the change journey even easier to
take.

Let's go!

### Tweak the environment



The reasoning under this heading is that if you change the situation,
the context we act in the change in the behaviour will follow. For
example - if you have a system for queuing up calls in a call center ...
a lot of calls will be in queue. To get quicker response time, throw the
system out and have direct access. A bit brutal example but you get what
I'm aiming at.






So what could we do to tweak the environment to make better,
more qualitative meetings happen?






For starters if you go to all meetings there's no wonder that you're
attending a lot of meetings... Not everyone have to go to every meeting.
They are called meeting requests for a reason, people!






State, loud and clear, that it's ok to decline invitations if you have
other, more important stuff to do. Push the responsibility out to each
individual. "You are responsible for your own time. You own what you do
with it each day".


#### Attendee creep

A very big problem at one client I was working as was that invitations
was resent. This meant that I invited Roger and he thought that maybe
Mattias should hear about this too. And Mattias in turn thought that
this could probably be good if we shared with everyone doing .NET
development.






So when the actual meeting took place I was not met by Roger but rather
by 25 devs. Totally different meeting, and given an average hourly rate
of say 1000 SEK that meeting now costed 26 000 SEK / h. Not my
intention.






A brute force, tweak the environment way of handling this is to sure
that you don't allow resending of invitations. If more people should be
added you could always go back to the sender and check with her. This
gives better control of the attendee creep and the focus of the
meeting.




This can probably be enforced technically if you want too.


### Build habits



A habit is something we do without thinking, it doesn't take any effort
from our Rider. It just happens this way. A great example of this is an
agile team that stop in their tracks and fix a broken build as the build
agent informs them too.






Checklists are also good for this and I've talked about them <a
href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2012/09/applying-switch-framework-to-meetings.html"
target="_blank">already</a> in this series, but it could be as simple as
posting a checklist in each meeting. Or putting an timer in each room
that can be winded up to the right amount of time for the meeting,
helping us to keep our time box.






Another great tip here is to stand up for short meetings. Yes - I said;
stand up for the stand-up. <a
href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=36533086#editor/target=post;postID=496174853263675189"
target="_blank">There's a reason to do so</a>. We don't want it long.
Standing up will help it to be so. Still I see a lot of teams sitting
down for their standup ... and the meetings starts to linger of course.

Start tracking the quality of each meeting with a simple <a
href="http://www.stickyminds.com/sitewide.asp?Function=edetail&amp;ObjectType=COL&amp;ObjectId=6559"
target="_blank">ROTI (Return On Time Invested)</a> the way out of the
room. Supply templates for doing so and post them on the doors for
example. This will have a two-folded effect;




1. You, as an organiser, will start to see trends and get some data to
    improve upon. If you collect them and analyze them you can start to
    see company trends
2. Everybody knows that we will do a ROTI of the meeting quality after
    each meeting. This will put a little pressure on us to do a good
    meeting. Nothing to threaten people with but just making sure that
    we think.





Try to find simple stuff that helps us getting into the motion of just
doing right. I once heard Microsoft use the phrase "increase
the likelihood of us falling into the pit of success". Do that!


### Rally the herd

Now we probably got a few people with us on the train. Now we want the
spread the word - start an epidemic about doing great meetings.






Here you want to create forums and meeting places to share tips and
tools for conducting great meetings. Start book circles or other things
for interested people. Focus on the people that is driving this on - the
other will follow and there's no use wasting time on the negative
persons in the beginning.






Maybe even record some meetings for inspiration. Or track the number of
meetings / months with a ROTI over 3.






This heading touches on the Grow your people-heading in <a
href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2012/09/applying-switch-framework-to-meetings_20.html"
target="_blank">post 2</a> - we want to create a culture of us being
great at meetings. Help this culture to spread.


### Conclusion



That ends this mini-series on how help us getting to the bottom with the
problem about people perceiving meetings as not being real work.






I'm sure that you have a lot of ideas that I've missed. Please comment
and leave them here. I want to improve.






There's a lot of little things that make the change happen of course.
You need to address both the Rider and the Elephant, in different ways
too. Maybe not everything should happen at once, but rather gradually be
built into the culture at your company.






But you can start. With the people around you - make the change happen!
The subtitle of the Switch book is "How to make change when change is
hard". All of the stories in the book are about people with little or no
official power that made a big difference in their environment. You
could be that person too.
