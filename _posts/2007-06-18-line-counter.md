Here is something that always is a point of discussion in software
development projects; "How many lines of code is this, anyway?"

[This is a add-in](http://www.wndtabs.com/downloads/PLC221.zip) to
Visual Studio (worked like a charm on my 2005 version) that counts the
lines of code, in- and excluding comments and blank rows if you want
to.

Really nice actually and quite fun also. It is at least some kind of
measurement, for the project
management anyway.

Oh yeah - in six weeks we have produced 48 000 lines of code... We're so
proud! But also, I once heard that typically a programmer introduce a
bug with every 100 lines of code he write; that gives us 480 bugs in the
system. For that we would not be so proud.. :)
