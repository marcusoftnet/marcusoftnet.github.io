I
realize, when skimming through my posts on the blog, that this happens
from time to time ... but i have learned some great programming skills
the last week.

At <span>Avega</span>,
where I work, we gave a seminar on Spring.NET, Dependency Injection and
Aspect Orientation... and once again - i think i am in love.

For the first time i finally understood Dependency injection and then
the pieces and <span>beauty</span> of Spring.NET was very
obvious.

Here are some links that might be useful:
