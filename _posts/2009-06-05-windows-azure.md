I don't know that much about [Azure](http://www.microsoft.com/azure/) yet, but I am quite sure it will become more and more important in the future.

From what I understand now, it's Microsoft's platform for developing applications that use services "in the cloud." Behind the buzzwords, you'll find a range of services accessible over the internet, including storage, logging, and other low-level services, as well as Microsoft Live Services, CRM services, and more.

The whole idea is that with these services in place, you can get up and running much faster.

OK â€“ sounds like a good idea. Let's see it in action. [Here are some videos](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dd439432.aspx).
