I don't know that much about
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/azure/" target="_blank">Azure</a>...
yet. But I am quite sure that is will be more and more important in the
future.

From what I understand now it's the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">Microsoft</a>
platform for development of application that uses services "in the
cloud", as you should say these days. Behind the buzzwords you'll find a
bunch of services that can be reached over the internet that you can
take advantage of. These includes storage, logging and other low level
services but also Microsoft Live Services and CRM services etc.

The whole idea, I guess, is that given these services in place you can
much faster get up and running.

OK - sounds like an good idea... Let's see it in action.
