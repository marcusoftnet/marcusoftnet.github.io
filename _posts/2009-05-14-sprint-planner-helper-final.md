I have had some real problems to get going with the [Sprint Planner Helper Project](https://www.marcusoft.net/search/label/Sprint%20Planner%20Helper) after the trip to [Ethiopia](https://www.marcusoft.net/2009/05/pictures-from-ethopia.html). I am not sure why – but it made me think about the project, the scope, and purpose.

First and foremost – I am not working, I am on parental leave. That means this is my spare time project and I [promised myself](https://www.marcusoft.net/2009/01/what-to-do-now-sprint-planner-helper.html) that I would end it if I didn’t feel up to it for some reason. Since I have found it hard to restart, I conclude that I have reached that point.

Secondly – the main reason and purpose of the project was to learn, not to produce a wonder-application (although that would have been nice :)). I think that I have learned quite a lot during this project and that I am at a junction right now. You cannot pursue depth in all directions.

OK – what were my learning goals and where have they taken me?

#### [DDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design)

The main purpose was to look into Domain Driven Design. I feel that I have got a nice grasp around that subject – and I most certainly want to learn more. I’ll write a separate post about my thoughts on DDD and its implications on your project.

**UPDATED**

[Here is my post on DDD](https://www.marcusoft.net/2009/05/ddd-whats-deal.html)

#### [TDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)

When I started the Sprint Planner Helper project, I liked tests. Now they are a part of the way I code. Over and over again you are struck by the fact that doing test first actually improves your code quality and helps you find flaws in your code early. I like that. Might be a post on these findings also.

#### [ASP.NET MVC](http://www.asp.net/mvc/)

Finally, a web framework from Microsoft that I understand! I’ve been doing WebForms on and off during several years and still don’t get it. Actually, I don’t think many do (how many developers fully understand the implication of [this](http://emanish.googlepages.com/Asp.Net2.0Lifecycle.PNG)…)

After doing ASP.NET MVC during this project, I can honestly say that I will surely continue and never look back. Also, the community is exploding with [examples](http://blogs.msdn.com/brada/archive/2008/01/29/asp-net-mvc-example-application-over-northwind-with-the-entity-framework.aspx), [code](http://www.codeplex.com/MVCContrib), and [projects](http://code.google.com/p/sharp-architecture/) that will assist you in creating great code. And of course the introduction [Nerd Dinner chapter](https://www.marcusoft.net/2009/03/aspnet-mvc-nerd-dinner-example.html).

I am ridiculously proud of being the number one hit on [this search](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=nerd+dinner+mvc&meta=). Before the actual book itself!

#### [Extreme OOP](http://milano-xpug.pbwiki.com/f/10080616-extreme-oop.pdf)

Eeeh – you can’t win them all, now can you? Actually, this was the one thing that I pretty soon abandoned. Not that I don’t like the rules and the way they improve your code quality, but it was one thing too much to think about.

I think that if you want to learn this, you’ll need to do a separate project that solely focuses on extreme OOP. And that would be quite fun.

Actually, in the [PDF](http://milano-xpug.pbwiki.com/f/10080616-extreme-oop.pdf) I am linking to above, you find an exercise that’ll get you started.

#### Where to go now

Some other reasons for me to stop is that I have found some great resources that are much more ambitious than my feeble tries. Here is a short list of them. Be sure to check them out, I know I will:

- [Sharp-architecture](http://code.google.com/p/sharp-architecture/) – a base architecture that lets you build web applications with ASP.NET MVC and NHibernate. Here is an [introduction video](http://dimecasts.net/Casts/CastDetails/75).
- [ASP.NET MVC Contrib](http://www.codeplex.com/MVCContrib) – this is a project on CodePlex that collects “nice to have” features for ASP.NET MVC, such as [grid helper methods](http://mvccontrib.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Grid&referringTitle=Home), [validators](http://www.codeplex.com/xval), [routing engines](http://mvccontrib.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Routing&referringTitle=Home), and [view engines](http://mvccontrib.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Brail&referringTitle=Home) etc.
- [InfoQ's book on Domain Driven Design](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/model-to-work-evans)

So I hope that anyone who has read this has enjoyed it for as long as it lasted. I know that I have learned a lot and that doing this project has made me a better developer.

The code will still be available at <http://sprintplannerhelper.codeplex.com/>, if not contact me to get it. I might even re-start the project later.
