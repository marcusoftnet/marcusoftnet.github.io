I have had some real problems to get going with the <a
href="http://www.marcusoft.net/search/label/Sprint%20Planner%20Helper"
target="_blank">Sprint Planner Helper Project</a> after the trip to
<a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2009/05/pictures-from-ethopia.html"
target="_blank">Ethiopia</a>. I am not sure why – but it made me think
about the project, the scope and purpose.

First and foremost – I am not working, i am on parental leave. That
means this is my spare time project and I <a
href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2009/01/what-to-do-now-sprint-planner-helper.html"
target="_blank">promised myself</a> that I would end it if I didn’t feel
up to it for some reason. Since I have found it hard to restart I
conclude that I have reached that point.

Secondly – the main reason and purpose of the project was to learn, not
to produce a wonder-application (although that would have been nice :)).
I think that I have learned quite a lot during this project and that I
am at a junction right now. You cannot pursue at depth in all
directions.

OK – what was my learning goals and where have they taken me?

The main purpose was to look into Domain Driven Design. I feel that I
have got a nice grasp around that subject – and I most certainly want to
learn more. I’ll write a separate post about my thoughts on DDD and it’s
implications on your project.

**\[UPDATED\]**

<a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2009/05/ddd-whats-deal.html"
target="_blank">Here is my post on DDD</a>

#### <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development"
target="_blank">TDD</a>

When I started the Sprint Planner Helper project I liked test. Now they
are a part of the way I code. Over and over again you are struck by the
fact that doing test first actually improves your code quality and helps
you find flaws in your code early. I like that. Might be a post on these
findings also.

#### <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/" target="_blank">ASP.NET MVC</a>

Finally a web framework from Microsoft that I understand! I’ve been
doing WebForms on and off during several years and still don’t get it.
Actually I don’t think many do (how many developers does fully
understand the implication of
<a href="http://emanish.googlepages.com/Asp.Net2.0Lifecycle.PNG"
target="_blank">this</a>…)

After doing ASP.NET MVC during this project I can honestly say that I
will surely continue and never look back. Also the community is
exploding with <a
href="http://blogs.msdn.com/brada/archive/2008/01/29/asp-net-mvc-example-application-over-northwind-with-the-entity-framework.aspx"
target="_blank">examples</a>,
<a href="http://www.codeplex.com/MVCContrib" target="_blank">code</a>
and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sharp-architecture/"
target="_blank">projects</a> that will assist you in creating great
code. And of course the introduction <a
href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2009/03/aspnet-mvc-nerd-dinner-example.html"
target="_blank">Nerd Dinner chapter</a>.

I am ridiculous proud of being the number one hit on <a
href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=nerd+dinner+mvc&amp;meta="
target="_blank">this search</a>. Before the actual book it self!!!

#### <a href="http://milano-xpug.pbwiki.com/f/10080616-extreme-oop.pdf"
target="_blank">Extreme OOP</a>

Eeeh – you can’t win them all, now can you? Actually this was the one
thing that I pretty soon abandoned. Not that I don’t like the rules and
the way they improve your code quality but it was one thing to much to
think about.

I think that if you want to learn this you’ll need to do a separate
project that solely focus on extreme OOP. And that would be quite fun.

Actually, in the
<a href="http://milano-xpug.pbwiki.com/f/10080616-extreme-oop.pdf"
target="_blank">PDF</a> i am linking to above, you find an exercise
that’ll get you started.

#### Where to go now

Some other reasons for me to stop is that I have found some great
resources that is much more ambitious than my feeble tries. Here are a
short list of them. Be sure to check them out, I know I will:

-   [Sharp-architecture](http://code.google.com/p/sharp-architecture/) –
    an base architecture that let’s you build web applications with
    ASP.NET MVC and NHibernate. Here is an
    <a href="http://dimecasts.net/Casts/CastDetails/75"
    target="_blank">introduction video</a>.
-   <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/MVCContrib" target="_blank">ASP.NET MVC
    Contrib</a> – this is a project on CodePlex that collects “nice to
    have” features for ASP.NET MVC, such as <a
    href="http://mvccontrib.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Grid&amp;referringTitle=Home"
    target="_blank">grid helper methods</a>,
    <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/xval" target="_blank">validators</a>,
    <a
    href="http://mvccontrib.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Routing&amp;referringTitle=Home"
    target="_blank">routing engines</a> and <a
    href="http://mvccontrib.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Brail&amp;referringTitle=Home"
    target="_blank">view engines</a> etc.
-   [InfoQs book on Domain Driven
    Design](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/model-to-work-evans)

So I hope that anyone who has read this has enjoyed it for as long as it
lasted. I know that I have learned a lot and that doing this project has
made me a better developer.

The code will still be available at
<http://sprintplannerhelper.codeplex.com/>, if not contact me to get it.
I might even re-start the project later.
