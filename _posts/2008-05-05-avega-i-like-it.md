My company, [Avega](http://www.avega.se/), is back from a conference
on
[Iceland](http://images.google.com/images?q=iceland&rls=com.microsoft:sv&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&startIndex=&startPage=1&um=1&sa=N&tab=wi).

The conference in it self was a great success. Very well organised, good
weather (which does NOT happen often at Iceland, from what i
understand), great fun with great people.

But once again I come to think about how blessed I am with my
surroundings. I'll give you an picture which I have experienced several
times the last year or so:

Think about when you have done something extra with others, for example
went to a camp, a great vacation or some thing else of that kind. When
you are traveling home you always get a strange feeling with a strong
sense of wanting it to go on, don't you?

Well, for me, it does!

This weekend i have had some great times with a great bunch of people.
Lots of interesting, fun and engaging discussions and get togethers.
Lots of things going well in the group,
[people](http://blogg.joakimsunden.se/) getting rewarded for efforts
during the year. Doing a lot of fun stuff together.

And that is were I work! What a feeling!

I have the same feeling with [my
family](http://www.marcusoft.net/2008/03/abbe-growing-and-growing.html),
my Salvation Army Corps and my
[band](http://www.marcusoft.net/2008/03/cd-in-can.html)... and that
pretty much sums up the things I do. The only word i can think of that
explains that is blessed. I am truly blessed in my life right now.

Thank you all you Avegaean (oh yeah, even cooler in English) people for
a great weekend.
