Today i have had this blog for a whole year. I never thought that it
would evolve to this. Here are some interesting (?) facts and statics.


-   First - i was wrong of course - the first posting was actually on
    2006-10-24 but i have only have had statics since 2006-10-29.
-   Total number of posts: 270. Which average to 0.73 post a day.

-   Top content is the sketch [Mor i
    skutan](http://marcushammarberg.blogspot.com/2007/08/mor-i-skutan.html)
    with 168 hits
-   Best visitor day was 2007-10-15 with 98 different visitors
-   I've changed the layout for the blog 4 times (if i remember
    correctly)
