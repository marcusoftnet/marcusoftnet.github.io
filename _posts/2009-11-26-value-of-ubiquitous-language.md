The concept of a **ubiquitous language**—a common domain model—can be interpreted differently depending on the context. Here's how I see it:

### For the Entire Business

An all-encompassing ubiquitous language for an entire business often seems impractical. Different contexts and departments may define the same entities (e.g., "customer") differently. For a deeper discussion on this, check out:

- [Casey’s blog on integration at the database level](http://devlicio.us/blogs/casey/archive/2009/05/14/commercial-suicide-integration-at-the-database-level.aspx)
- [Dan North’s SOA insights](http://dannorth.net/classic-soa)

### For an Application

On the other hand, having a ubiquitous language within an application is highly beneficial. This means that all team members—customers, analysts, developers, testers—use the same terms consistently. This practice enhances communication speed and accuracy within the team.

For more insights on the value of a ubiquitous language, consider these resources:

- **Eric Evans’s book**: [Domain Driven Design](http://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215). [Read the relevant chapter on Google Books](http://www.google.com/books?id=7dlaMs0SECsC&lpg=PP1&dq=Domain%20Driven%20Design&hl=sv&pg=PA24#v=onepage&q=&f=false).
