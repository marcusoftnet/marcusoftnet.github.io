A few days back we had a mail-wise discussion on the subject; why should
we care about an
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design"
target="_blank">ubiquitous language</a>?

For me the question falls into two parts; for the whole company/business
or for the application.

-   An ubiquitous language or common domain model for a complete
    business have never felt right with me. I know, I know; I have been
    defending it, striving for it and even forced it on some customers –
    but I don’t like it!
    It will never work! The same entity, (customer) for example, can
    have very different meanings in different context.
    A better and much more detailed discussion can be found here:

    -   And in

        North’s</a> excellent
        <a href="http://dannorth.net/classic-soa" target="_blank">SOA for the
        rest of us</a>
-   An ubiquitous language for an application is a completely different
    thing and is something that I think should be strived for. But that
    basically means that all the members of the team (customer,
    analysts, developers, code, tester, documentation) referrers to the
    same things with the same name.
    For me it has to do with speed and accuracy in communication within
    the team.

But don’t take it for me. I did a quick search through the net and found
some articles that gives better points on why an ubiquitous language is
a Good Thing:

-   It starts and ends with
