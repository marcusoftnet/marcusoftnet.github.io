I own a, now, quite old MP3 player called [IRiver
H320](http://tbn0.google.com/images?q=tbn:50tN7Jbthhm7UM:http://lingon.files.wordpress.com/2006/07/00114893.jpg).
And even though I am often heckled by IPod-owners I still love it. It
has some features that no-one have included in another product. For
example:

- The possibility to directly connect it to another device and move
    stuff between them.
- You can download a separate operating system and install that on the
    device if you like.

That second point is quite cool and I've just downloaded the latest
version of [RockBox](http://www.rockbox.org/) - a free open source
operating system for MP3-players. Quite cool as [I
wrote](https://www.marcusoft.net/2006/11/rockbox-cool-stuff.html) a long
time ago... [Their
installer](http://www.rockbox.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/RockboxUtility)
was also something quite extra. Best I've seen in a long, long time - it
literally was one or two clicks.

The only thing that remains to be solved is that my battery is very
short-lived now. I've been using the IRiver everyday more or less, for 3
years straight, so I presume that it's OK.

Found this great site, <http://www.batteryupgrade.com>, where you can
buy batteries for almost any device imaginable. Great!
