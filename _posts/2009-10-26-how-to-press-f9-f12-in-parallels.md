OK – I am a developer. I use all these crazy keys and combination that I
suspect no normal person would ever think about. But for us (developers)
a combination like CTRL+R,T (run all test in Visual Studio Solution) and
CTRL+SHIFT+F11 (Step out of function while debugging) makes perfect
sense. It’s no biggie.

I suspect that the
<a href="http://www.parallels.com/" target="_blank">Parallels
Desktop</a>, which I love by the way, didn’t think primarily of
developers when they thought about the keyboard integration. But that’s
ok – I’ll just learn some new funky combinations and away we go.

So if you want to press any of the F9-F12 keys in a Parallels Desktop
Windows image running on a Mac – you’ll get quite surprised. The Mac
command takes upper hand (that goes for all F-keys actually). And
<a href="http://kb.parallels.com/en/5020" target="_blank">here is
how</a> to get by that.

Kind of – that didn’t work on my Mac Book Pro. But \[COMMAND\]+\[FN\]+F9
works. So:

> Mac Book Pro go **\[COMMAND\]+\[FN\]+F9**

Really nice to include the \[FN\]-key and not any of the \[ALT\] or
\[CTRL\]-keys since they are used sometimes. For example; here is my new
favorite shortcut in Visual Studio (running on a Parallels Desktop
Windows Image)

> Delete All breakpoint? That’s easy; just go
> \[COMMAND\]+\[FN\]+\[CTRL\]+\[SHIFT\]+F9.

Hehe – new world record!
