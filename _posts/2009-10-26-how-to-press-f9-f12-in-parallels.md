As a developer, I often rely on a variety of keyboard shortcuts and function keys. For instance, I use `CTRL+R, T` to run all tests in a Visual Studio solution and `CTRL+SHIFT+F11` to step out of a function while debugging. These shortcuts are second nature to me.

However, when working with a Parallels Desktop Windows image on a Mac, I encountered some challenges with accessing the F9-F12 keys. By default, Mac’s command key takes precedence over function keys, which can be inconvenient for developers.

Here’s how you can use the F9-F12 keys in Parallels Desktop on a Mac:

1. **For Function Keys F9-F12**: Press `[COMMAND] + [FN] + F9` (or F10, F11, F12 as needed).

   This combination works for me on my MacBook Pro, whereas the standard methods described in [Parallels support documentation](http://kb.parallels.com/en/5020) didn’t quite work.

2. **Favorite Shortcut**: One of my favorite shortcuts in Visual Studio while running in a Parallels Desktop Windows image is deleting all breakpoints. The shortcut is `[COMMAND] + [FN] + [CTRL] + [SHIFT] + F9`.

It’s interesting how adapting to new environments can introduce new shortcuts and combinations. Even though it took a bit of trial and error, finding these shortcuts has been quite helpful.

Enjoy your coding with Parallels Desktop!
