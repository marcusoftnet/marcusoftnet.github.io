As
you might have notices the activity on the blog has been quite low for a
couple of weeks. This has to do with loads of stuff piling up at work
and a fully booked private calender.

The new project, that I am involved in at work, is really fun but also
one of the most dazed I've been in. We are throwing ideas out the window
every other hour. Last week I was in a design meeting from Monday
morning at nine to Thursday afternoon at three.
Also - as always in between these hectic meetings it's quite hard
to have thing to be busy with all the time. Confusing but very true - it
will be a great project when we get the form for it (and we are well
under way...)

Private - there have been things to do almost every day for the last
three weeks now, since the
[marathon](https://www.marcusoft.net/2008/05/commenting-stockholm-marathon.html).
This weekend is the last of these. When it gets like this I can't find
peace to rest even when I am free. Sad but true. It just feels like
another "item to be checked off in the calender".

Well - as I was saying; I can see the light in the tunnel. That must be
a good thing... don't you think? ;)
