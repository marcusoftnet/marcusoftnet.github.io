As I <a
href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2009/09/vasa-band-and-saturday-night-success.html"
target="_blank">wrote before</a> we are very blessed right now in the
<a href="http://www.vasaband.se" target="_blank">Vasa Band</a>. It seems
like we really are used by the Lord and that the music we play is filled
with his presence.

And the best part of it that it feels just right and like what we always
wanted and has done.

target="_blank">Here is a recording of a concert</a> (beware 45 mb!) we
did Sunday night with
<a href="http://www.windcorpbrassband.se/members/andreas_k.html"
target="_blank">Andreas Kratz</a> conducting.

As always; I am so proud and happy to be a part of this great band and
to be a Salvation Army bandsman. I have played with some great bands –
but this is the greatest feeling, if nothing else.

Thank you guys – let’s continue on this path. And thank you Andreas
Kratz for making us great!
