As I [wrote before](http://www.marcusoft.net/2009/09/vasa-band-and-saturday-night-success.html), we are truly blessed right now in the [Vasa Band](http://www.vasaband.se). It feels like our music is deeply infused with the Lord’s presence, and everything seems to be aligning perfectly with our long-held aspirations.

We recently had another wonderful performance on Sunday night, conducted by [Andreas Kratz](http://www.windcorpbrassband.se/members/andreas_k.html). You can listen to a recording of the concert [here](http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/2408484/VasaBand091011.zip) (please note the file is 45 MB).

I am incredibly proud and grateful to be part of this amazing band and to serve as a Salvation Army bandsman. I've played with many great bands, but the sense of fulfillment and joy I experience with this group is unparalleled.

Thank you, everyone—let’s keep moving forward on this path. And a special thanks to Andreas Kratz for helping us shine!
