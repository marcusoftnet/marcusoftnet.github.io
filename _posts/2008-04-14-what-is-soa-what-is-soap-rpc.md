The now almost age-old question; "but what is
[SOA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture) then?"
has been out for debate at the office where i am right now. It must be
stated that this is a gang of developers and quite often the questions
bubbles down to; "but this line of code then, is this
[SOA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture)?".

I took some time over the weekend and though about it - and came to the
conclusion that you cannot answerer that question because the question
is not correct in itself.
[SOA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture) has to
do with switching position and behold your world from another angle, was
my conclusion.

And lo and behold; today i found an article that explained a lot of
stuff surronding this for me:

Great explanation of the differences between
[SOA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture) and
SOAP-RPC.
