I don't like meetings. Because most meetings I've attended has not been great. And I'm guilty of organizing some of those meetings too.

In this presentation I talk about how to make [effective](http://www.marcusoft.net/2015/01/i-dont-care-about-efficiency-until-we-know-our-goal.html) meetings. There will be a lot of small advices that I've found useful during my consultancy. I will also briefly describe the Lean Coffee meeting format.

Here's all the post in the series (the links will work as I post them):

I've built the presentation around the [PDCA-cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA); Plan meetings, Do meetings, Check the outcomes of the meeting and Act to improve the next meeting.

In PLANing Meetings I find that a missing Goal, or a Why is the most common and disruptive for any meeting. After that comes that people don't know why they are in the meeting.
The final thing that often happens are meetings no or badly followed time boxes.

In the DO-ing of a meeting the Goal of the meetings comes back as one of the big issues that we need to make sure that everyone knows, in order to be effective.

Following time box and take short breaks are things that I've found vital to make your meeting focused and productive.

All of this is summed up in the [Lean Coffee meeting format](http://www.marcusoft.net/2013/01/how-to-run-leancoffee-discussion.html)

The final two parts of the PDCA-cycle; Check and Act are the most important to make sure that you are in fact improving.

I CHECK my work with a simple Return On Time Invested (ROTI) voting.

The ACTing is a bit more complex, but I've seen just posting meeting guidelines in each conference room work really well. Or in other cases even having a Meeting Coach that gathers and distributes the good habits and ideas.
