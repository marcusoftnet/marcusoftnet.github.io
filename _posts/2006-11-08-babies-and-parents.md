Yesterday
we had a coffee with two of our best friends that are becoming parents
in a few days...

Really exciting and it made me ponder for a while;
How is it that when you met some parents and children it makes you feel
like you never want to get children of your own and others have the
quite opposite effect.

The first group of parents you all know - it's the ones walking three
baby carries on a line, taking forever to order in McDonald's and still
needs to go there on rush hour and meeting for a mum-coffee (6 mums
also) in the small coffeeshop on the corner and still demanding the room
at the far end, children running around.

The other group is like my friends; the children is a wonderful
enrichment to their life but the don't become hardcore-parents from the
same day they knew they were pregnant. Here's a cool quote from
yesterday; "last night may have been the last day we saw Sopranos in bed
without a baby between us". Also I am meeting another friend tonight,
mum since half a year, for dinner - no problemo. They have their own
night "off".

There you have it - I know a lot of parents that would have said: "last
night was the last night we saw Sopranos." Period!

Go all cool parents that still is able to keep some swing to their life
even with children.
