![Rock Swings Album Cover](/img/rockswings.jpg)

Got a new CD this weekend, [Paul Anka - Rock Swings](http://www.amazon.com/Rock-Swings-Paul-Anka/dp/B0009A1BXG). This is so good! And Mr. Anka sings greatâ€”I can't believe he's over 70 years old.

On the CD, he (or someone) has put together some hits from the Rock and Pop world from the last two decades and turned them into Big Band pieces. They are all executed in a way that makes you feel that this is the way the song was supposed to sound. I love it.

I realize that some people would probably knock me out for saying so, but I really like this. This is one of those recordings that could (and would) have been destroyed if it weren't for the great musicians, great arrangements, etc. Songs like "Jump" by Van Halen and "Smells Like Teen Spirit" by Nirvana would probably make some fans cry...

Also, Mr. Anka is a very funny name in Swedish. "Anka" translates to "Duck," and Paul Anka could very well be a relative of Donald Duck. But seeing the cover, I am not sure...
