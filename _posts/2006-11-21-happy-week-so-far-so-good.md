Well, well, well - this [happy week
stuff](http://marcushammarberg.blogspot.com/2006/11/be-good.html) seems
to be working... One day with no anger and everything is dandy. Did take
to much effort either.

I even managed to handle some bumps in the road yesterday, with some
laughter and dancing (?!?!) instead of digging graves. There might be
something here.





If this continue i will have to extend the period - let me get back to
you on that.
