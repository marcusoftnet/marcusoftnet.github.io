Well, well, well—this [happy week stuff](http://marcushammarberg.blogspot.com/2006/11/be-good.html) seems to be working... One day with no anger and everything is dandy. Didn't take too much effort either.

I even managed to handle some bumps in the road yesterday, with some laughter and dancing (?!?!) instead of digging graves. There might be something here.

If this continues, I will have to extend the period—let me get back to you on that.
