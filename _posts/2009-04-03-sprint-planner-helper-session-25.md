Today I will continue working on the model, surrounding Sprints, and of
course drive it forward with tests.

I came to realize today that I am now converted. I am now a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development"
target="_blank">TDD</a> guy. I will do tests even if it’s not required
of me. And the reason is security and speed.

I have gone from coding along with no worries – the tester will find
(any) bugs for me… Then I heard of unit-testing and started to write
some – just for fun in the start (yeah – pretty sick). After a while I
didn’t dare to check in any code that I couldn’t prove with some test –
but a wrote the code first. And after a while of doing that, I was so
feed up with running behind with the tests that thought I’ll give true
TDD a chance.

What I pretty soon came to realize is that not only was the code easier
to test that way (doing the test first) – but I often spotted bad design
and code even as I was writing the test. Before the code was even
written, if you like.

That’s my reason for doing TDD.

OK – on to the code.

More test are written – more knowledge about the domain is acquired. I
really like this way to get about the model.
