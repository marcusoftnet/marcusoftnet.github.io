This weekend has been a weekend of reclamations; i've been around the
several stores demanding different stuff to be replaced. It's been beds
(IKEA), whisk (Åhléns), shoes (Wedins, they lasted about two months...)
and finally phones (yes,
[again](http://marcushammarberg.blogspot.com/2007/10/non-exsisting-service-quality-at-phone.html)) -
i'll get back to the phone-part.

So first of all this makes me wonder; is the quality level of things
that we buy going down (this sounds like the start of a
Sex-and-the-city-episode). I have actually never before been to a store
to demand things back - not until last year. And now i have been back
with about 5-6 things and four of them last weekend...

My thinking is that this has to do with the urge to make fast money. You
cut a few corners, put things faster on the market and hope that no-one
will notice or at least don't have the strength or will to complain.

So now to my mobile-phone. Yes again. Read [this
post](http://marcushammarberg.blogspot.com/2007/10/non-exsisting-service-quality-at-phone.html)
for complete story up to now. Well - since the phone still is no better
and i really need a working phone in these baby-waiting-times, i thought
that i would make a last push.

Back to The Phone House (yes the company without service thinking, you
know). I told the young man that i have been to them four times, and
have had my phone on repair three times. And yes, here are the receipts
for the last two times the phone has been repaired.
"Oh i am sorry. I sure believe you, but they (HTC, i presume. My
comment) will have to a list of all the times the phone has been
repaired"
"But can't you find the receipt in your computer machine?" - i replied
stupidly. Of course they can.
"No - I've searched it now and no receipt can be found"

At this point i left the store. I wasn't sure what to do now. Leave the
phone again - wait another three weeks and hope that i don't lose the
chain of proof... That was the Phone House suggestion.

But then it dawned on me; there is another Phone House at
Västermalmsgallerian. I'll try to fool the system. So i went there. Met
Alexander. His first reaction;
Alex: "Have you been leaving the phone for repair two times?!!!"
Me: "No three - but i only have the receipts for the last two times on
me"
Alex: "No problemo - they are right here in the computer. Do you need
the original receipt for the phone also?"
Me: "D...d...duh?"
Alex: "I'll tell you what. I'll make sure that the phone gets sent to
HTC and that you'll get a new in a box. If you want it you can take it -
if not you can upgrade to another better phone."
Me: "... Hello... i am from earth. Are you an angel? When will it be
done?"
Alex: "If you don't hear from us in about a week and a half - get down
here and I'll help you."

So besides that Alexander really has got the meaning of service - this
was an eye opener. I am sorry to say that it comes down to that they
don't want to help you. I mean they really could find my receipts - they
just didn't want to.

So i am still convinced that the service policy of The Phone House
stinks. It can only be instruction from the company not to help their
customers. Sorry to say so.

Thanks Alexander for great service in a bad environment.
