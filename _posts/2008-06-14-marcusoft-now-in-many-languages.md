Today I found a nice little [tool from
Google](http://translate.google.com/translate_tools) that helps readers
of this blog to understand the content of it in a better way.

The tool "simply" translates the page, <http://www.marcusoft.net/> in
this case, into the language of your choice. Pretty cool!

I found it when my father told me that some of the nuances of the blog
were lost in their translation of my page. Let's see if
[Google](http://www.google.com/) with do a better job.

So here you go - <http://www.marcusoft.net/> in 25 languages! All thanks
to [Google](http://www.google.com/)

Yeah - that's right.. you'll find the tool to the right, just below my
links.
