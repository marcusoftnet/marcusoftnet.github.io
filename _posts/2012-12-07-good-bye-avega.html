<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Today is the last day I work for <a href="http://www.avegagroup.se/">Avega Group</a>. It's the best place I ever worked at to date. I've been there for almost 8 years and see the company grow from 50 people to about 400 people.<br /><br />During this time I've learned a lot from a lot of amazing people. I've grown as person and in my career to someone that I never&nbsp;thought&nbsp;that I could be. A lot of this has been due to the support Avega and all the people there have given me.<br /><br />To say good bye properly I recorded a little (8 mins) movie with some memories from the Avega office that I will carry with me forever. It's in Swedish so for all you english people (68% according to Google Analytics) I'm sorry about that, but this one goes out to my&nbsp;colleagues&nbsp;at Avega.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><object width="320" height="266" class="BLOGGER-youtube-video" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data-thumbnail-src="http://0.gvt0.com/vi/uL_iOr8pGOw/0.jpg"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/uL_iOr8pGOw&fs=1&source=uds" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><embed width="320" height="266"  src="http://www.youtube.com/v/uL_iOr8pGOw&fs=1&source=uds" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><span style="text-align: left;">Avega - I love you!</span></div>I've had the time of my life - I hope you have too!<br /><br />The world is not so big - we'll probably run into each other out there. A lot I hope!<br />Bye for now.</div>
