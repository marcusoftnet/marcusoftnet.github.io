Last Thursday was an exciting day. After a not-so-well-planned [post](http://www.marcusoft.net/2009/04/debating-hero.html) about a previous article, we finally had the chance to host a visit from one of the giants of IT, [Ivar Jacobson](http://www.ivarjacobson.com/).

I've made a brief recap of his visit [here](http://blog.avegagroup.se/Elevate/archive/2009/09/17/be-smart-med-ivar-jacobson.aspx) (in Swedish). What stood out for me was not just the wealth of experience he brought, but also his enduring enthusiasm for the field.

I was particularly struck by his perspective on the IT industry as a fashion industry, constantly chasing trends. Ivar now emphasizes focusing on the practices used within various processes, rather than the processes themselves, as a way to provide great support for organizations.

One of his statements made me laugh: "We really have gone crazy with the documentation" (my translation). This from the father of [RUP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Rational_Unified_Process), a methodology that many have turned into a documentation-heavy behemothâ€¦

It was truly an honor to meet Ivar Jacobson in person and hear him speak about topics he's clearly passionate about.
