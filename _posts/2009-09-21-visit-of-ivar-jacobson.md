Last Thursday the day had finally arrived. From a not very well planned
<a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2009/04/debating-hero.html"
target="_blank">post after an article</a> it has been quite a journey to
finally get a visit from one of the IT-gigants –
<a href="http://www.ivarjacobson.com/" target="_blank">Ivar
Jacobsson</a>.

I have made a short recap of what he said <a
href="http://blog.avegagroup.se/Elevate/archive/2009/09/17/be-smart-med-ivar-jacobson.aspx"
target="_blank">here</a> (in Swedish), but the main thing for me was
just to see and hear a man with that amount of experience, with all the
enthusiasm still intact.

Also I like the ideas on the computer industry being a fashion industry
that chases trend after trend. Ivar has started to look away from the
different processes and instead focus on the practices that is used and
can be combined into great support for the organization.

I really laughed hard at one of his statements: “We really has gone
crazy with the documentation” (my translation). This said from the
father of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Rational_Unified_Process"
target="_blank">RUP</a> that so many people has misused into
documentation-mecca…

It was really a honor to meet Ivar in real life and hear him talking
about things that he obvious love to talk about.
