I've just downloaded and started to read the [Imposters Handbook.](https://bigmachine.io/imposter/), by [Rob Conery](http://rob.conery.io/). It's a book about all those things that you don't want to reveal that you don't know. I most of them I **should** know since I have read Computer Science. But I don't. It's a great (in all senses of the word â‰ˆ500 pages!) read  and promise to deliver even better things ahead. Go get yours now!

As I started to read it I heard a familiar voice in my head. Rob Conerys. And I just realised how much I've learned from him.

Dear Rob,

I first heard your name when you created a course on ASP.NET MVC for the [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET)-site. That technology was brand new back then. I then followed you as TekPub was started and I have seen just about everything you ever produced. I've also enjoyed some of the courses produced for [PluralSight](http://www.pluralsight.com) once TekPub was acquired.

I thoroughly enjoyed [This Developers Life](http://thisdeveloperslife.com/) that I've heard most episodes of, at least 2 times each.

Here's a non-exclusive list of the things that I've started to use and learned or picked up - initiated by you;

* Git - I did **not** understand that at all before your TekPub course
* ASP.NET MVC - I got this, but so much deeper knowledge was gained via you. Especially the first ASP.NET MVC 2 course with Steven Sandersson
* Linux - never touched before your stuff, woven into many TekPub courses
* Angular/Backbone and the general notion of front-end frameworks
* Node - never heard of before your course back in the day
* JavaScript - this was pure witchcraft for me and I didn't want to poke it with a stick.
* CoffeeScript - same as above
* Elixir - thoroughly loved the [RedFour](http://www.redfour.io/) course that I took this summer

3-4 of those things are things I use everyday. Two of those things are things that I've myself created [courses on for PluralSight](http://app.pluralsight.com/author/marcus-hammarberg). Starting to use Linux, Node and JavaScript opened new worlds for me that I, as a ".net only developer" never would have looked into before.

That price of such education can be calculated and is set by PluralSight etc. But - the *value* of that education, for me as a user, cannot be measured. In short terms it has made my a much, much better professional.

I've never met you in real life. To be quite frank I sometimes find you a little bit intimidating on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/robconery), but since you are outspoken and get a lot of push-back - I can totally understand your reactions sometimes. That said the teaching style, voice and general presence on stage is very laid back and pleasant - and that's the person I feel like I know through the hours of teaching.

## Summing up

I'm not a particular "Rob Conery"-fan boy - I don't listen to/read/learn your stuff just because it's you. I enjoy your stuff just because it's been perfect content and timing for me.

And in doing so I realised, when I started to read the Imposter book to learn even more, that I just needed to write a proper Thank you down. Because I learned so much from you!

Thank you Rob!

Your teaching, presenting, screen casting, pod casting, blogging and writing helped me immensely. For this

I'm deeply grateful.
