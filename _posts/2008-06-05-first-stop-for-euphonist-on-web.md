This guy, [David Werden](http://www.dwerden.com/), has been around
on the net for quite a while. But now he has expanded his site with a
[blog](http://www.dwerden.com/blog3/) and some other [great
stuff](http://www.dwerden.com/music-videos/euphonium-music-videos.cfm).

If you want to really dive into euphonium stuff then this is the place
to be. And I want to, sometime.
