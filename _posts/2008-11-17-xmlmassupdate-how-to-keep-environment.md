Another great finding in MSBuild for me recently is the use of the
XMLMassUpdate task of [MSBuild Community
Tasks](http://msbuildtasks.tigris.org/ "MSBuild Community Tasks").

For quite some time now I have always kept a separate .config-file for
each environment. Even though I always has gone "hmm... but wait a while
here... 90% of this file hasn't changed from the last environment...".

But you don't get the time to investigate always. But now, again after
some <a

target="_blank">thoughtful input by colleagues</a>, I noticed the
XMLMassUpdate.

With it you can easily keep a file with the changes for each environment
and then let your build script generate the right version for the
environment the script is building. This means that you only need to
keep the differences (deltas I think it's called in formal speak) of the
different files. Great!

Here is an <a

target="_blank">great article</a> describing how to use the
XMLMassUpdate-task.

I bet you can use this task to generate some code also if you want to...
Just imagine to generate a project-file that includes some autogenerated
classes, that compiles into... <a

target="_blank">Brrr</a> could be ugly or hard to handle. Not for me...
Now.
