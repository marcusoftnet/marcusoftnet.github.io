So, why
do i always think that "it will be lesser to do this semester" - when i
know...

This week contains a lot of different stuff to do, most fun but they are
really packing up. It's something "extra" on the agenda each day of this
week. But compared to the opposite (nothing to do) i would choose this
every time, twice on Sundays :).

So I'll try to report here whats going on.

Last week ended in a good way at work, anyway, since we cheat-started
(that what was needed) our new architecture in a small part of the
system. Felt really good since we have been waiting for that part to
start for about a year now. I hate waiting.
