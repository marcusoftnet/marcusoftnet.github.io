The
last couple of days I have been home sick. The first time in at least
five years.

It is so boring - every time
i get to much on my hands I always fall into thinking that it would be
so nice to be home a couple of days. But when you are you're not
feeling well and nothing is fun to get started with. So you end up with
boredom.

Well - I am back now - still not feeling well but it was just to boring
to bare it... I've seen all the series and watch all my DVD's that was
appealing. I was missing my code ;)
