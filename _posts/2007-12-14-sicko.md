The
last couple of days i have been home sick. The first time in at least
five years.

It is so boring - <span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">every time
i get to much on my hands i always fall into thinking that it would be
so nice to be home a couple of days. But when you are <span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">you're not
feeling well and nothing is fun to get started with. So you end up with
boredom.

Well - i am back now - still not feeling well but it was just to boring
to bare it... I've seen all the series and watch all my <span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_3" class="blsp-spelling-error">DVD's that was
appealing. I was missing my code ;)
