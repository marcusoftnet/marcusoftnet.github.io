Found
this page <http://www.themusicpage.com/> that streams a lot of different
contests and performances from brass brand all over the world - seems to
be a bit a heavy on the down-under side but a lot of great stuff can be
found there.

For example recordings from the English Nationals that took place this
weekend, with [Grimethorpe](http://www.grimethorpeband.com/) as the
winning band.
