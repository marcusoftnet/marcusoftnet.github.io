After spending a few days working with Fluent NHibernate, Iâ€™m finding it to be a fantastic tool. One feature that stands out is the ability to [test your mappings](http://wiki.fluentnhibernate.org/Persistence_specification_testing). This feature is especially useful as it allows you to switch to an in-memory database, such as [SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org/), which speeds up your tests and eliminates the need for a complex database setup.

For a solid introduction to [NHibernate](https://www.hibernate.org/343.html) and [Fluent NHibernate](http://fluentnhibernate.org/), check out the articles by [Gabriel Schenker](http://blogs.hibernatingrhinos.com) from Hibernating Rhinos. These articles cover mapping testing and are available [here](http://dotnetslackers.com/articles/ado_net/Your-very-first-NHibernate-application-Part-1.aspx) (Part [1](http://dotnetslackers.com/articles/ado_net/Your-very-first-NHibernate-application-Part-1.aspx), [2](http://dotnetslackers.com/articles/ado_net/Your-very-first-NHibernate-application-Part-2.aspx), and [3](http://dotnetslackers.com/articles/ado_net/Your-very-first-NHibernate-application-Part-3.aspx)).

And I love this quote: "*If you continue to implement your own data access code, you are stealing (money) from your customer*."
