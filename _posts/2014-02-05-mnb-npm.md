I'm writing down some of the things I've picked up when I started to
learn
about <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Node</a>, <a href="http://expressjs.com/" target="_blank">Express</a> and <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/" target="_blank">Mongo</a>.
Here are all the post in the series:

This post is about the Node Package Manager, npm, and some of it's many
features.

<span
id="more"><a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Node</a>
is really cool, but without it's package management system,
<a href="https://npmjs.org/" target="_blank">npm</a>, and the plethora
of packages out there it would be pretty bland and probably not as well
known.

I will not talk much about the packages out there. They are LEGIO and
increases each day. Check out [https://npmjs.org](https://npmjs.org/)
and be amazed. The packages comes ago almost by the hour. Keeping track
of what's hot and what's not is a near impossible task. I usually look
and ask around in my network to find out what is worth using and not.

But the npm tool, let's talk about that. The most common commands are of
course:

-   <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">npm
    install - installs all the packages listed under dependencies
    in<span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">
    package.json, into the node_modules folder
-   <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">npm
    install \[thePackage\] - installs thePackage into your
    node_modules folder
-   <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">npm
    install \[thePackage\] -g - installs thePackage gob ally,
    that is reachable from all the node projects on your machine. This
    can be useful for tools that you're running from the command line,
    like mocha for example. I would recommend that you include all tools
    needed to run your project in the project local node_modules folder.
    But don't check node_modules into git (ignore it in your .gitignore)
-   <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">npm
    uninstall \[thePackage\] - well... uninstalls thePackage, of
    course
-   <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">npm
    update \[thePackage\] - updates the package to the latest
    version on [http://npmjs.org](http://npmjs.org/)

What's really cool with npm is that it can be extended, as I mentioned
in my <a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2014/02/mnb-packagejson.html"
target="_blank">package.json post</a>. Under the "scripts" node in
package.json you can add commands to npm. Here's an example, an extract
of a package.json file:


These line give you four new subcommands to npm:



-   <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">npm
    start - will execute "node app.js" and hence start your app.
    You can imagine other commands for starting, like
-   <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">npm
    runstart_dev - that starts your staging configuration for
    example
-   <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">npm
    test - execute the mocha command above. If you need other
    switches you can just update your package.json.
-   <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">npm run
    test_watch - is one example that adds the "-w" switch and
    hence is watching my directory for changes and rerun all the tests
    in it.

You can of course as many commands as you like. It's a really nice
feature if you consider the fact that people who bring your code down
will have your commands available to them.
