Have been reading up on SCRUM and found some nice articles and presentations.

[This is an overview](http://www.scrumforteamsystem.com/ProcessGuidance/Scrum/Scrum.html) from a company that apparently has developed a Add-in for Visual Studio Team System to use on SCRUM-projects, but don't mind that but focus on the important stuff about SCRUM instead.

Here's another good introduction site: <http://www.scrum-master.com/>, especially check out Ken Schwaber's top ten tips

Coming from the RUP-methodology I like the presentation but I also realize that this a bit against the whole "agile"-concept. In short - i like it.
