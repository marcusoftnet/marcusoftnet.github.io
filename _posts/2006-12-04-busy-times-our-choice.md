It's a
very busy time right now. The band is in the midst of our long list of
December engagements. So fun and good it has been so far! Last night we
played at the annual
[Lucia-coronation](http://www.city.se/ArticlePages/200612/03/20061203202200_137/20061203202200_137.dbp.asp)
at [Skansen](http://www.skansen.se/). A bit cold but the band played
well and we had great fun.

So this week contains a Christmas-festival at our corps and a gig in a
Church... And then there are only two things left! Phew! But i like
it.

Yesterday morning we had an Advent-service at our corps and the
commissioner of Sweden Victor Poke spoke about the different parts of
the time up to Christmas. Made my think about bringing some calmness
into this the most busy of times. Why is that? Why not lower the
ambitions a bit and enjoy a lovely time of the year? It will be my motto
for this advent-times.
