Bobby McFerrin is known to a broader
audience for the summer-hit "Don't worry, be happy". But that is such a
little part of his work. And his real genius lies in his voice.

This guy has control, and loads of it. When I heard this clip yesterday
I found myself with my mouth open through out the whole thing.
And then I checked this out where he improvises over a Air by Bach. My
good! He is the king!
