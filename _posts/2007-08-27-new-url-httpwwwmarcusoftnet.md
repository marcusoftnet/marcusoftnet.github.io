I've just registered, what I think is a quite good domain name: <https://www.marcusoft.net/>. And the blog is now found under that name.

For non-techie people - here is the explanations behind the name:

- My name is Marcus - **marcus**oft.net
- I am a software developer (and maybe a soft dude too, I hope) - marcusoft.net
- I program in .NET - marcusoft**.net**
- <https://www.marcusoft.net/> is quite like another computer related company, Microsoft

So here you are - hopefully the site will be something more than the blog - but this is it for now.
