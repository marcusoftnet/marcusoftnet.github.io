I've just registred, what i think is a quite good domain name:
<http://www.marcusoft.net/>. And the blog is now found under that
name.

For non-techie people - here is the explanations behind the name:

- My name is Marcus - **marcus**oft.net
- I am a software developer (and mayby a soft dude too, i hope) -
    marcu**soft**.net
- I program in .NET - marcusoft**.net**
- <http://www.marcusoft.net/> is quite like another computer related
    company, Microsoft

So here you are - hopefully the site will be something more than the
blog - but this is it for now.
