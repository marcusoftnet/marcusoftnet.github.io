<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-error">Soo</span> -
today the Europeans will start. My thoughts and hopes are of course with
the <span>="blsp-spelling-error">Gothenburg</span> Brass Band. I had the
<span>="blsp-spelling-corrected">opportunity</span> to hear the band a
few weeks back i can say that they are in very good shape indeed.

But - i don't think it will take them all the way. There are some
insanely good bands competing this year.

Here is my very "from-the-hip" prediction of how the Europeans will
end:

1.  Cory
2.  <span>Stavanger</span>
3.  <span>Gothenburg</span>

It of course will have to do with how and what the judes think about the
different styles of playing.
