Soo -
today the Europeans will start. My thoughts and hopes are of course with
the Gothenburg Brass Band. I had the
opportunity to hear the band a
few weeks back i can say that they are in very good shape indeed.

But - i don't think it will take them all the way. There are some
insanely good bands competing this year.

Here is my very "from-the-hip" prediction of how the Europeans will
end:

1.  Cory
2.  Stavanger
3.  Gothenburg

It of course will have to do with how and what the judes think about the
different styles of playing.
