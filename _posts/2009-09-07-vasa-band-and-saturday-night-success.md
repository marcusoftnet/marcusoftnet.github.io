This weekend, the band I play in, the [Vasa Band](http://www.vasaband.se), had the privilege of performing at the Salvation Army's regional congress in Örebro. We were invited to participate in the musical festival on Saturday.

In preparation, a few of us brainstormed ways to bring something new and different to the performance. We drew inspiration from some [great bands](http://www.blackdykeband.co.uk) and put together a short program featuring music from our latest [CD – Priority](http://www.vasaband.se/index.php?id=6).

Our performance was very well received, making a significant impact. More importantly, we felt that many people experienced the presence of God and his message through our music. This is always our greatest hope and longing, and it was particularly evident on Saturday.

It feels wonderful to continue this journey with my fellow band members.

I'll try to upload some photos from the evening soon.
