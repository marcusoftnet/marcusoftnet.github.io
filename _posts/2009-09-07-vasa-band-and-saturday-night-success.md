This weekend the band I play in, the
<a href="http://www.vasaband.se" target="_blank">Vasa Band</a>, had an
opportunity to play at the Salvation Army regional congress in Örebro.
We were invited to play in the musical festival at Saturday.

When we learned about this a few of us started to think in how we could
make something new and different. And so we borrowed ideas from some
<a href="http://www.blackdykeband.co.uk" target="_blank">great bands</a>
and put together a short program with music from our latest
<a href="http://www.vasaband.se/index.php?id=6" target="_blank">CD –
Priority</a>.

It was very well received and we really made a big impact. But what felt
very good was many people felt the presence of God and his message to
them as we played. This is always our greatest hope and longing. And
this Saturday it was very obvious.

Feels really good to continue on that road with my fellow
bandsmen/women.

I’ll try to upload some photos from the evening later
