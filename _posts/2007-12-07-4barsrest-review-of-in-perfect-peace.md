4BarsRest
has just reviewed the last CD from Gothenburg Brass Band - In Perfect
Peace. You can read it here:
<http://www.4barsrest.com/reviews/cds/cd344.asp>




It's a more warm and appreciating tone and language
the suites the spirit of the band and Bengt.




And my notes goes unmentioned which i only can takes as it was not too
bad. Phew!




On the more serious side - this is a very good recording from a very
good band. Go get it! Now!
