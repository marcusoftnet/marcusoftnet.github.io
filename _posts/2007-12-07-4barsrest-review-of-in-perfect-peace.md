4BarsRest has just reviewed the last CD from Gothenburg Brass Band - In Perfect
Peace. [You can read it here](http://www.4barsrest.com/reviews/cds/cd344.asp)

It's a more warm and appreciating tone and language the suites the spirit of the band and Bengt.

And my notes goes unmentioned which I only can takes as it was not too bad. Phew!

On the more serious side - this is a very good recording from a very good band. Go get it! Now!
