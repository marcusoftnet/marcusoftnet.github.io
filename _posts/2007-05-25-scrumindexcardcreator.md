I have thrown together a small application for generating index cards
from a Excel-based backlog list. This is very handy when you do sprint
planning meetings. A printed index card is easier to move around on a
withe board than a row in Excel.

The ScrumIndexCardCreator reads an Excel-file and lets the user select
one or more to print. Its not very fancy but it still get the work done.
To the right you'll find some screenshots of it.

Anyone interested in it can contact me marcus,hammarberg(a)avega,se
