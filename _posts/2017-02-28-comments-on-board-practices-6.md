Many daily stand-up meetings adhere to Scrum's traditional format, where each team member reports on their activities from the previous day, plans for the current day, and any impediments they face.

While well-intentioned, this approach misdirects our attention.

Ensuring team members stay busy isn't as crucial as ensuring work flows smoothly.

A simple adjustment can realign our focus, particularly during morning meetings.

# Introduction

I once lost a contract for affirming:

> Are you the one telling teams that individual busyness isn't important?

Yes, I did say that. And it's true.

Most of us don't ponder this much, but the [three questions (™)](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/three-qs/) overly emphasize individuals. Yet, our objective, like in many other practices, is to swiftly deploy small features to learn and adapt.

## Why Address This Issue?

By prioritizing people over work (as LeanKit illustrates in their insightful article ["Watch the Baton, Not the Runner"](https://leankit.com/blog/2015/05/business-flow-watch-baton-not-runner/)), we stray from lean principles.

### Lean Philosophy

Lean, as depicted in [This is Lean](http://www.thisislean.com/), balances resource efficiency (utilization) and flow efficiency (effectiveness). Although detailed elsewhere, I'll share this insightful image by Per Åhlström and Niclas Modig:

The essence is achieving optimal flow by focusing on work, not individuals.

I find the emphasis on individuals distracts from critical discussions and improvements. For instance, the common post-three-questions inquiry:

> Does everyone have work to do now?

However, as [Niclas Modig argued at LeanKanban Central Europe](https://www.lkce16.eu/speakers/niklas-modig/), a 100% utilized team stifles innovation and customer focus.

### Agile Manifesto

Beyond lean, prioritizing individuals over work contradicts two principles of the [agile manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html):

* Simplicity—maximizing work not done—is essential.
* Working software is the primary measure of progress.

Focusing on individual busyness neglects these principles, deviating from the core agile ethos.

## What to Fix/Do Instead?

Let's move beyond theory and take action.

Recognize the disparity between resource busyness and flow effectiveness. Then, adjust morning meetings to center on work, not individuals.

### Simplify Morning Meetings

Instead of questioning each team member, focus on the work:

* Identify each task on the board.
* Discuss impediments hindering flow.
* Direct attention to tasks deviating from the flow.

This streamlined approach not only maintains focus but also accelerates meetings.

### Tailoring for Large Teams

For larger teams, streamline meetings by:

#### Focusing on Anomalies

Prioritize discussions on anomalies rather than routine tasks:

* Unassigned work.
* Columns exceeding WIP limits.
* Blocked items.
* Resource monopolization.

Addressing anomalies catalyzes process improvements.

#### Problem-Solving Orientation

Direct meetings toward problem-solving:

* Identify obstacles.
* Delegate resolutions to involved parties.
* Avoid prolonged discussions in meetings.

Solve issues efficiently, keeping meetings productive.

### Mitigating Managerial Overtones

To prevent meetings from feeling like reports to management:

Rotate the daily facilitator role.

This fosters inclusivity and eliminates hierarchical undertones.

# Summary

In morning meetings, prioritize discussing work over individual updates. Focus on facilitating work flow by addressing impediments and anomalies on the board.
