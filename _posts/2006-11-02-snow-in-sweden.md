Today, and most of all yesterday, was the first snowstorm of the winter in the Stockholm area.

Every year, I'm saying every year, we miss this. First, the trains are stopped by falling leaves, and then, what do you know, snow? Here in Sweden? How can it happen?

People couldn't get home, **all** buses in the Stockholm area stopped, etc. But then again, we knew about this storm for about two weeks.

Maybe if the buses had winter tires on, or all other vehicles for that matter, it wouldn't be such an issue.

Anyway, this catches us each year, and I am not expecting any co-workers until 10 o'clock today.
