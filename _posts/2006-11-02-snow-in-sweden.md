Today, and most of all yesterday was the first snowstorm of the winter in
the Stockholm-area.

</div>

<div>

Every, i'm saying every, year we miss this. First the trains is stopped
by falling leafs and then, what do you know, snow? Here in Sweden? How
can it happen?

</div>

<div>

That never fails. Yesterday was worse than ever (literally thousands of
people not being able to get home, **all** busses in the Stockholm area
stopped etc) but then again we knew about this storm for about 2 weeks.

</div>

<div>

Maybe if the busses have had winter tires on, or all other vehicles for
that matter (people have left their cars in the middle of the road
tonight).

</div>

Anyway, this gets us each year and i am not expecting any co-workers
until 10 o'clock today.
