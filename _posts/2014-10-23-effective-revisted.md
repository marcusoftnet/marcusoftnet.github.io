I'm talking a lot about **effectiveness** and how it difference from
**efficiency**. This probably have to do with two things; first - the
difference between these two concepts is at the heart of the lean
mindset. The second fact is that I'm Swedish.

Swedish is a very poor language compared to, for example English, that
is much richer. If I was to translate the first sentence of this blog
post in Swedish you'll get what I mean:

> Jag pratar ofta om **effektivitet** och hur det skiljer sig från
> **effektivitet**

Ah, the poverty! It's the same word. There's no difference... in
Swedish. I've still to understand if that means that Swedes are focused
on effectiveness of efficiency.

But this poverty has been a trigger for learning for me. I've really
tried to deep dive in this.

To this date this is the best and hence simplest way to describe the
difference between the two concepts:

> For a sprinter, **efficiency** is about running without wasting
> energy. Make sure your hands doesn't take a lot of air, be very
> particular how you move your legs, when is the best time to raise your
> head, how long should your steps be in the beginning, middle or end of
> the raise. How do I use the energy from the start in my first 10
> meters. Etc. Etc.

> For a sprinter, **effectiveness** is running in the right direction.
> Towards the goal, if I may offer a suggestion.

Effectiveness has to do with reaching our goal. In fact I don't care
much about efficiency until we know where we are going. Imagine see
Usain Bolt take off from the starting block and run the wrong way! We
would all go;

> Why on earth did he do that? Don't he know where he's going? He knows
> where the goal is right?

Very few would say;

> Yeah sure, he ran the wrong way, but did you see those knees?! Perfect
> execution - very efficient!

### You're a running expert now? What does this have to do with us?

Still in many organisations... we are not in agreement about the goal -
the vision that I've blogged about recently. And many many organisations
are trying to optimise our efficiency.

Let me give you a couple of examples;

### IT development at Insurance company

At one big company I was consulting at the time from idea for new
software feature (even small things like spelling fixes, or layout or
reports) to deployed software was 8 months. The actual programming time
was a couple of days, sometime hours.
Where do you think we started to implement efficiency?
Yes that's right - we trained the developers in being more efficient.
Surely that would help us.

. In fact a lot of the time was waiting time. Decided on beforehand by
schedules. Because we only deploy 4 times a year. It's right there. In
our IT-policy.

#### What is the goal in this case?

Software exists to solve a problem for an user. Until it's used software
is truly useless, to use the wise words of <a
href="http://zuill.us/WoodyZuill/2012/09/16/agile-maxims-presentation-at-agile-open-socal-2012/"
target="_blank">Woody Zuill</a>, and the
<a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html"
target="_blank">agile manifesto principles</a>. The goal is to have the
software used by users.
To become "more effective" would mean to give the users more useable
code faster.

### Health care

Right now I'm serving in a new area (and a new country) trying to help
the six hospitals that the Salvation Army has in Indonesia. I went in
very bold - effectiveness; I know this. Just make the system flow faster
to the end-customer, which is the patient in this case.

#### What is the goal in this case?

But ... what is the goal of a health care service provider. Is it speedy
delivery really... No not really. The goal of health care (as I think
now, I hope this changes to something wiser) is to cure the patient, or
quality in the health service.

Using effectiveness as your guiding star and principle you will
automatically get a patient perspective and put the patient (who said
end-customer?) in focus. This how we measure the quality of our
service - the experience and end-result of the patient.

Sure the internal processes are important and needs to be looked over
but if we're not putting quality care first and the patient in focus...
we're running the wrong way.

That doesn't mean that a fast flow is uninteresting. If your process
flows faster the quality have to be good. If your process produce bad
quality you will end up creating waste in the form or rework and failure
demand.
The difference, for me, is that for other business (such as
manufacturing and software development) the faster flow can in itself be
something to strive for. In health care I see it more as a mean to
increase the quality - which is the goal of the system.

### Pastors, coaches and parents

For a pastor the effectiveness will be ... eeeh? This is harder. The
only thing I'm sure of is that counting the number of pastoral calls,
number of meetings held, number of prayers said etc. is not the target.
This at best measuring the efficiency of the pastor.

And that's not what we are after - we are after the effectiveness of the
system. The goal, the purpose of the pastor being in the church. Or
having a church in the first place.

#### What is the goal in this case?

I'm no pastor. And I don't for a second think that I know more about
their very special job than they do. I simply cannot answer this
question adequately.

But this is a nice way to reason about this question that I've used for
myself, when I was asked the same kind of question about the role of an
agile coach:

> If we didn't have a pastor here - how would you notice the difference?

> If the team didn't have an agile coach - how would that change the
> team? What would be better? What would be worse?

> As a parent what kind of outcomes am I looking for in my kids, that my
> parenting has given them?  

I'll leave that as an exercise for you to think about. When I come up
with something worth writing I'll come back to you.

### Summary

To me this has a strong connection with a holistic systems thinking
view; we more interested in the output / outcomes of the system rather
than optimising certain parts of the system. It is as a whole that we
can effect the overall effectiveness of the system.

To know about the goal of the overall system we need to step back and
ask ourselves **why** we are here. What is the purpose of our
organisation? Why do people turn to us?

Those are hard questions to answer sometimes. Hard because they might
point to that the kind of efficiency increasing measures we are focusing
on today, might not be the correct ones.

Are you ready to ask those questions? Are you willing to change to
improve for real? To improve the effectiveness rather than to improve
efficiency? Are you willing to not only run fast - but to run towards
the goal?
