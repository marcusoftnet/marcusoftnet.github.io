The season has started for the brass band in UK and Black Dyke kicked it off with a tour of the Netherlands.

Here is a clip from a concert. This is the overture! Listen to the playing and especially the soprano - just imagine to play like that and have two hours of the same before you. And listen to the reception
afterwards - that could make you go on I presume.

Also observe that the euphoniums turn pages after about 40 seconds - its that many notes! Cool!
