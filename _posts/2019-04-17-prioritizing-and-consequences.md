Been talking a lot about the consequences of prioritizing today at my client. And about [psycological safety](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BAmaH1_U4z5tc3QpV5pMDoPsGmVSVYdSzefIfwjeT7E/export?format=pdf)

This [excellent story](https://jamesclear.com/buffett-focus) that Staffan introduced me too, came to mind. (I'll summarize it below - this is just an intro, to get you to read on)

And I came to think about how the consequences of prioritizing one thing over other, often ends up becoming blame for the team. When it really should be praise...

## The Story

The [Warren Buffet story](https://jamesclear.com/buffett-focus) goes something like this: 
Mr Buffet asks his pilot to list his top 25 career goals. He does and returns to Mr Buffet only to get another request: Now please circle the 5 items on that list. This is of course tricky but after sometime he comes back. 
Mr Buffet now ask his pilot: `What are you going to do with the other 20?` and obvisoly he answers that this is for later, or as he get time. 

To this Mr Buffet responds:
> No. They are no on your avoid-at-all-cost-list. 

Because if not the 5 prioritized items are not prioritized. He should drop the other 20 items and not look back or feel regret. Until he has capacity to take on new items, for example when the first 5 are completed. 

## Observation

When we prioritize we choose something over something else, with good intentions. This is what [prioritizing means](https://www.google.com/search?q=defintion+prioritzation&rlz=1C1GGRV_enSE816SE817&oq=defintion+prioritzation)

> the action or process of deciding the relative importance or urgency of a thing or things

So when we, in a team, chose to spend time on thing A over thing B - it is for a reason. That reason might be good (more value sooner for example) or bad (someone screamed at us to do it). But that doesn't really matter. We have made our choice: Item A it is
