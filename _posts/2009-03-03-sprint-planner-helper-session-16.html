<p>I am now almost ready with the first user story of my own backlog.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>1. As user I can create a product that describes the product and the product owner so that the purpose of the product is known. </p>    <p>Each product has a product backlog that describes what is left to do. </p>    <p>Each product backlog item requires at least an Number(1.2.1), description, initial priority. </p>    <p>Other properties are story points (how big is this compared to other) and a document with additional business rules.</p> </blockquote>  <p>The one thing that is left is to be able to create new backlog items. </p>  <p>My GUI for editing a product right now looks like this:</p>  <p><a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TI0jeIedRFk/Sa0LXJyuBzI/AAAAAAAAADc/Mr9OUo8Y3IA/s1600-h/edit%20a%20product%5B3%5D.jpg"><img title="edit a product" style="border-top-width: 0px; display: inline; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="307" alt="edit a product" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TI0jeIedRFk/Sa0LYLIAuFI/AAAAAAAAADg/twDyhMfi4gc/edit%20a%20product_thumb%5B1%5D.jpg?imgmax=800" width="244" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>and as I said before I will not put to much effort into the design of the GUI, but I have noticed that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller" target="_blank">MVC-pattern</a> opens up for GUI-design decisions to be change later on. I mean – there is a product backlog item create action that can be outputted as a pop-dialog or on a own page or via AJAX/Flash or …</p>  <p>That is a really nice feature. </p>  <p>Come to think of it – this is one of the main thing of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design" target="_blank">DDD</a>. You are given the freedom to choose (and change) how to solve when the time is right. This goes for all the ends of the application design; the database and the GUI for example.     <br />The important stuff (ie. the model) is what you need to worry about. </p>  <p>OK – on to the code! Lets write some simple test…</p>  <p>I brushed on some <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb383977.aspx" target="_blank">extension methods</a> today. They are cool but a bit messy since they don’t belong in the class they are extending… I am not sure if I like them or not.</p>  <p>I came as far as I could create the form for creating new product backlog items. Tomorrow I will save them. </p>  <p>PS. Passed 100 unit tests today. Yeah!</p>
