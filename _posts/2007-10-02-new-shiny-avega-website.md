Yesterday [Avega](http://www.avega.se/), my company, released it's new,
better, bigger and nicer website. And it really is! Go there now:
<http://www.avega.se/>

Well worth the wait and a major, major improvement over the last one.
Really nice design and easy on the eye. And quite informative also -
lots of interesting content to read about [Avega](http://www.avega.se/)
and the consultants.

Right... almost forgot; I am on the site. If you go to the first page
and wait for a while I'll flash (no pun intended) before your eyes. My
10 seconds of fame on the net.

This site adds to the <span style="color:#ffff00;"><span
style="color:#000000;">proud feeling I already have for
[Avega](http://www.avega.se/). The best place I've ever worked on. If
you're interested of joining us, please let me know.
