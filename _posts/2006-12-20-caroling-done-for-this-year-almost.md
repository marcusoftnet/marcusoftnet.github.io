Yesterday we did the last Caroling-gig (you know; the Salvation Army
playing with a pot for coin collection, as seen in many films) for this
year with the Vasa Band. And that was something special I can tell
you:

Apparently this has been going on for a while now but the Old Town in
Stockholm is Organizing a advent-calender in the famous buildings around
the Old Town. So for example door 13 was in the castle and the King and
Queen went to do their little thing (mostly waving of hands). Yesterday
we took part in the opening of door 19 and there were about 200 people
there to see us. I was very surprised, but happily surprised.

The last Caroling for my part will be on Christmas eve when a
traditional gig will take place in Södertälje with the Salvation Army
there. Will be very nice to see all my friends in that band. It has been
a while
