As readers of this blog might have noticed I have not only switched to
Mac (Book Pro) but also have done so after a long while on the PC-side
of things.

I am not sure that it has anything to do with this but the wonderful <a

target="_blank">touch pad</a> on my Mac Book and I don’t click (no pun
intended). I may also have to do with lacking fine motorics…  but I hope
not.

One of my most trusted Mac-source have supplied me with this video.
Thanks Magnus.
