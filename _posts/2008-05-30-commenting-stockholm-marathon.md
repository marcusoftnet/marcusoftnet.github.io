This weekend one of the biggest sports events in Sweden will take place
in Stockholm - the Stockholm Marathon.

This year the only organisation that is allowed, offically, around the
course is the Salvation Army. The Salvation Army in Sweden has decided
to make an effort to raise money for [water tanks for schools in
Kenya](http://www.fralsningsarmen.se/dl2/p3/admin.nsf/wwwPublished/fralsningsarmen_startsida_kenya?OpenDocument).

The Vasa band, the band of my corps, will be playing at
[Odenplan](http://www.hitta.se/ViewDetailsPlace.aspx?vad=&var=odenplan&PlaceId=2471632)
during the day. Also the Source Of Joy gospel choir will be there.  

I have promised to speak during the day - and keep the day going. It
will be great fun -but quite challenging also - we will go on for almost
8 hourse straight!

Well, I'll get back to you with some information on how it went.
