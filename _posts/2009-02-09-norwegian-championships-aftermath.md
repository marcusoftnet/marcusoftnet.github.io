OK – <a
href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2009/02/norwegian-brass-band-championships-live.html"
target="_blank">my guess</a> wasn’t completely off (got the first right,
didn’t I). Oslo brass band chocked by coming second on the first year in
the championship section. Since I have played with a few of the bandsmen
(and women) in that band I was really proud. Well done – Tone, Mattias
and Clare!

Also <a href="http://www.ebml.no" target="_blank">Eikanger</a> has my
favorite euphonium player – Patrik Randefalk – and he and the rest of
the band was marvelous, especially on the <a

target="_blank">Extreme Makeover</a>.

But the thing that impressed me most was that the whole thing was taped
for
<a href="http://www.nrk.no" target="_blank">Norwegian television</a>.
And you can see every performance afterwards
