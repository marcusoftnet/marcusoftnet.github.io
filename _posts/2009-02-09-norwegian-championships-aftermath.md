OK – [my guess](http://www.marcusoft.net/2009/02/norwegian-brass-band-championships-live.html) wasn’t completely off (got the first right, didn’t I). Oslo Brass Band shocked by coming second in their first year in the championship section. Since I have played with a few of the bandsmen (and women) in that band, I was really proud. Well done – Tone, Mattias, and Clare!

Also, [Eikanger](http://www.ebml.no) has my favorite euphonium player – Patrik Randefalk – and he and the rest of the band were marvelous, especially on the [Extreme Makeover](http://go.nrk.no/go/e/article/http://www1.nrk.no/nett-tv/indeks/158909).

But the thing that impressed me most was that the whole event was taped for [Norwegian television](http://www.nrk.no). You can see every performance afterwards [here](http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/hordaland/1.6469847).
