A friend of mine sent me this link
<http://www.canonical.org/~kragen/tao-of-programming.html>
Very funny but also very true stuff. I almost became sad when I read
some passages (see for example the story about the programmer and the
project manager in Book 5,
<http://www.canonical.org/~kragen/tao-of-programming.html#book5>)

We have all been involved in these things, and often still are. Why?
"These are great mysteries. "
