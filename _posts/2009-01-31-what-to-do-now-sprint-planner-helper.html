<p>I'm free!!! So what do I do now. I have been talking to my colleagues that now that don't have to do boring work with them ;) I need another project in order to stay in touch with the IT-business. </p>  <p>Here is the reasons for me doing this at all:</p>  <ul>   <li>Have fun! - the second it's boring or takes to much time I'll end it. Promise</li>    <li>To learn about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design">DDD</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASP.NET_MVC">ASP.NET MVC</a>. These three things has attracted a lot of my interest I would like to try them out out. Oh yeah - it will be in C#! No more VB.NET for me - thank you very much.</li>    <li>Cannot take to much time (<strong>max</strong> 1 hour a day) - as stated earlier. I am not working!</li>    <li>Document my progress here on the blog. This idea is a complete rip off from a lot of different <a href="http://www.asp.net/learn/mvc-videos/#MVCStorefrontStarterKit">places</a>, but I could be nice to see if it attracts any reader and/or comments.</li> </ul>  <p>OK - what to do, what to do... I am a SCRUM guy and I would like some IT-support in certain phases of the project, most notable in the planning. Become: the Sprint Planner Helper (tm) (the trademark is just in my dreams... for now).</p>  <p>I whipped together a very basic initial product backlog. Any comments? Otherwise I get to it... maybe tomorrow. This has taken the first hour. Please comment if you think anything is missing or should be changed. All feedback is welcome.</p>  <p>1. As <a href="http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/product-owner">Product Owner</a> I can create a <a href="http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/product-backlog">product backlog</a> so that the team knows what is to be done. Each product backlog item requires at least an ID, description, initial priority. Optional are story points (how big is this compared to other) and the possibility to upload a document with additional business rules </p>  <p>2. As <a href="http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/product-owner">Product Owner</a> I can prioritize the <a href="http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/product-backlog">product backlog</a> by changing the priority on the product backlog item so that the team knows what is most important to me. </p>  <p>3. As <a href="http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/scrummaster">Scrum Master</a> I can create a team and invited team members. </p>  <p>4. As <a href="http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/scrummaster">Scrum Master</a> I can can create a sprint that represent the next sprint in order to plan out what the team can accomplish during that period of time. The sprint have a goal description and a start, stop and demo-date. </p>  <p>5. As <a href="http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/scrummaster">Scrum Master</a> I can calculate the ideal number of hours/man days by setting the percentage that a person is available (for part-time resources), the number of absent days and focus factor for each team member. </p>  <p>6. As <a href="http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/scrummaster">Scrum Master</a> I can create a <a href="http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/sprint-backlog">Sprint Backlog</a> by selecting items from the Product Backlog in order to plan the things to do during the sprint. The sprint backlog item can also be created from scratch. A sprint backlog item has an ID, Description, How-To-Demo-description, a list of Actions and a summarized total number of hours. </p>  <p>7. As <a href="http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/scrum-team">Team Member</a> I can add actions to a sprint backlog item in order to find out what to do to be done with the Sprint Backlog Item. Each action has an ID, Description and hours (max 8 h) </p>  <p>8. As <a href="http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/scrum-team">Team Member</a> I can update, change and delete Actions in order to easy plan the Sprint Backlog Item. </p>  <p>9. As <a href="http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/scrummaster">Scrum Master</a> I can create an initial <a href="http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/release-burndown">burndown chart</a> that shows the total number of hours (y-axis) and the date for the sprint (x-axis) in order to print it and use during the sprint. </p>  <p>10. As <a href="http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/scrummaster">Scrum Master</a> I can print nice card of all sprint backlog items and actions in order to put them up on the <a href="http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/task-boards">sprint task board</a>. This might include printing the actual task board...</p>
