Yesterday we finally had a long awaited meeting with the FutureForce for the Vasa Corps, my Salvation Army Church.

I am so privileged to be part of that group. They are some very nice and clever people and great things really happen when we get together. Like yesterday I thought I knew what was going to come out of the meeting but in the end something completely different but still very good came out instead.

That felt so good - just think if I had known what we should decided before the meeting. That would have been so boring.
