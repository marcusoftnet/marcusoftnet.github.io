Yesterday we finally had a long awaited meeting with the FutureForce for
the Vasa Corps, my Salvation Army Church.

I am so privilliged to be part of that group. They are some very nice
and clever people and great things really happen when we get togheter.
Like yesterday i thought i knew what was going to come out of the
meeting but in the end something completely different but still very
good came out instead.

That felt so good - just think if i had known what we should decided
before the meeting. That would have been so boring.
