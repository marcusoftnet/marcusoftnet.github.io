<p>After my <a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2009/03/sprint-planner-helper-session-18.html" target="_blank">refactoring yesterday</a> the function that re-prioritize product backlog items was reduced to swapping priority points on two items. </p>  <p>So that’s what I’ll do today. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development" target="_blank">TDD</a> through a function that swap priority points for an product backlog item and the item before (prioritize up) of after (prioritize down) it. </p>  <p>[Coding in progress]</p>  <p>That really was an old-time programming problem. Fun! But now I have TDD’ed a priority swap algorithm. That was all I managed to get through today. Some progress I think.</p>  <p>Now all that is left is to reach this functionality from the GUI and reload the list after it’s done</p>
