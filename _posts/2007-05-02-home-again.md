Just started the first day after a trip to Sardine (?) in Italy, with Avega.

What a great bunch of people! I really enjoyed myself during this trip. On the way home I had a feeling that often have come over me when I been on tours or camps... you know: "so - now it's over I we will never have this much fun again. Just think if it would last forever". Only difference this time is that it will last.

So a big thank you to all the organizers for the trip and to all the Avega People that made this trip into what it was - great fun and a great feeling of "we can do anything".

I'll upload some pictures to this post - some that not is to ... exposing
