Just started the first day after a trip to Sardine (?) in Italy, with
Avega.

What a great bunch of people! I really enjoyed myself during this trip.
On the way home i had a feeling that often have come over me when i been
on tours or camps... you know: "so - now it's over i we will never have
this much fun again. Just think if it would last forever". Only
difference this time is that it will last.

So a big thank you to all the organizers for the trip and to all the
Avega People that made this trip into what it was - great fun and a
great feeling of "we can do anything".

I'll upload some pictures to this post - some that not is to ...
