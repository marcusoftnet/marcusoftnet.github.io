It seems
like our baby is on it's way. Elin has become sick (nothing too serious)
in way that usually leads to the labour is started in a artificial way.
We are not too worried but it is really exciting that the nine months
are closing in to an end.

So perhaps the next time I write anything here I will be a father!
Amazing to think about. We hope that everything will go well and that i
soon can report any pictures on the little wonder.

Until then - or ...
