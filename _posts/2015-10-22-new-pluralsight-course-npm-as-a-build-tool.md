I've just (October 21 2015) got news that my latest course for [PluralSight](http://www.pluralsight.com/) is published.

[Find it here](http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/npm-build-tool-introduction).

This time I took the opportunity to put together a course on using npm (Node Package Manager) as a build tool. I think it makes for a very lightweight and flexible option for any JavaScript (or front-end heavy btw) project.

As you might know I've written a couple of posts on the topic:

* [npm scripting: git, version and deploy](http://www.marcusoft.net/2015/08/npm-scripting-git-version-and-deploy.html)
* [npm scripting: configs and arguments... and some more tricks](http://www.marcusoft.net/2015/08/npm-scripting-configs-and-arguments.html)
* [Pre and Post hooks for npm scripting](http://www.marcusoft.net/2015/08/pre-and-post-hooks-for-npm-scripting.html)

<!-- excerpt-end -->

In the course I dive much deeper and the topics discussed are:

* Initializing package.json with npm
* Running and writing scripts with npm and package.json
  * Writing custom scripts
  * Short cuts for common scripts
* Pre and post hooks for scripts, [see this](http://www.marcusoft.net/2015/08/pre-and-post-hooks-for-npm-scripting.html)
  * Hooks for custom scripts
* Scripts useful for development, supporting tasks as:
  * Compile Coffee-Script
  * Compile TypeScript
  * Refactoring
  * Less Compilation
  * Bundling with Browserify
  * Minifying with Uglify
* Watching folders and files and trigger on change:
  * Server Side Watching
  * Watching the Unwatchable
  * Using Nodemon
  * Client Side Watching
  * Live Reloading of Browser
* Versioning and deploying with npm, [see this](http://www.marcusoft.net/2015/08/npm-scripting-git-version-and-deploy.html)
  * Incrementing Version Number
  * Versioning Code in git
  * Push Code to Repository
  * Deploy the Application
  * Launch the Application
* Other useful tricks with npm

I think this is by far the best course I've made for PluralSight (my third) and I also think the topic is interesting and useful for most any Node / Front-end developer or team. It's simpler than Grunt/Gulp, quite simply.

I hope to see it do good.
