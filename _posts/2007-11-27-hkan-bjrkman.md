As i wrote the solo trombone of Stockholm Brass Band played a solo,
Doolalynastics, that just blew me and a large part of the audience
away.

Here is a video of that performance. For anyone into playing brass i can
say that this was the second last piece and before this we have just
played Celebration - notorious hard on the lip...
