<p>I been involved in many meeting booking activities during the last month. And it’s always the same – you send dates back and forth and finally decide.</p>  <p>If you have read <a href="Lean Software Development" target="_blank">Lean Software Development</a> by the <a href="http://www.poppendieck.com/" target="_blank">Poppendiecks</a> you know about <a href="http://www.targetedconvergence.com/setbasedthinking.html" target="_blank">Set-based problem solving</a>. </p>  <p>The <a href="http://whenisgood.net/" target="_blank">WhenIsGood</a>-website uses this approach to decide on an available meeting time, in a very simple and low-impact fashion. Look for yourself at their <a href="http://whenisgood.net/Videos" target="_blank">introduction video</a>. </p>
