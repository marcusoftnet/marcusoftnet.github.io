This post is work in progress - I'll finish it tomorrow.

I have been involved in many organisational changes that turns the organisation sideways. From functional departments to cross-functional teams, from projects and completing activities to continious delivery and focus on reaching effects.

Just about always this creates some initial confusion around where decisions gets made and how the old ways fits into the new. Quite often a worry about chaos break out. 

For example;

> Who is in charge of the overarching architecture, now that each team is deciding everything by themselves? 

I realize that I've done a bad job describing how this is going to work. The other week I found myself describing this with a pretty simple model that I wanted to share.

## Disclaimer

I'm pretty sure this is not news at all and I'm making a pale copy of something brilliant. But ... it's my copy and I'm standing by it.

## TL;DR

If you are in a hurry this is very simple to sum up: 

* Horiziontal groups are responsibile for prinicples

* Vertical groups are responsible for practices

## Longer version, but still not a novel

The reason we reach for cross-functional teams are that we have seen that the functional silos we had before did not work out well when we wanted to move work through the functions fast.

The good news of that approach is that each silo can ensure their values being addressed. For example, we can have the architects validated the solution before passing on to the coders, the security department can sign off on the solution and we can even have the regulatory demands being validated for compliance before moving on. 

The bad part with this approach is that it [doesn't work](http://www.marcusoft.net/2017/11/no-waterfall-is-not-sometimes-correct-it-is-always-wrong.html), creates sub-optimal, is very slow and cannot handle change well. Also it creates many hand-overs and a culture of someone ordering something and others (downstream) fulfilling that order.

Just about all the things that we want out of a process for *developing* something. Fast feedback and possibility to change frequently and fast. 



Therefor many companies nowadays creates *cross* functional teams, with responsibilities for the effect of the outcome of their work. Often they are responsible for a business capability such as order fulfilment or search or something similar. Work then can be completed within the bounds of one such team. If not we change the work to fit that structure, by breaking it down.

The good news with this is that we now have everyone we need within the same unit, it's fast to make decision and complete work. But foremost we can change how we work within this team in order to accomodate for our situation and style. 



The bad news is ... the purpose of this blog post. Becuase how do we now ensure that, for example, our architecture is followed, that everyone understands the security situation or that we all are keeping up to date with regulatory demands? 

### Principles and practices

Well, we create what has been refered to as guilds. Cross-functional structures
