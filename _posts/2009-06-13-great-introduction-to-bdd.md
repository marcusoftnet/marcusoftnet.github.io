<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_Driven_Development"
target="_blank">BDD</a> (Behavior Driven Development) is the next
natural evolvement from
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development"
target="_blank">TDD</a>. And since I am now converted to TDD I thought
I’d look into BDD.

Well – after scanning the net for a while I finally found a introduction
that I could understand. Here it
is:<http://dannorth.net/introducing-bdd>

From what I understand some colleagues implemented BDD with NUnit. You
can read about it <a
href="http://blog.avegagroup.se/HakanAlexander/archive/2009/02/20/bdd-med-nunit.aspx"
target="_blank">here</a> (in Swedish I am afraid), and also get some
code that can help you create some documentation á la
<a href="http://agiledox.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">agiledox</a>.

OK – the next thing to chew off… BDD looks cool.

**\[UPDATED\]
**I have now read some stuff about BDD and Dan North (who wrote the
article above) is, to my understanding, the father of BDD and that
article is actually the birth of the subject. Pretty good introduction.

[Here](http://blog.wekeroad.com/mvc-storefront/kona-3/) is a video that
has some nice examples and expand on the subject
