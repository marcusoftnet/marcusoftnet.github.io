[BDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_Driven_Development) (Behavior Driven Development) is the next natural evolution from [TDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development). Since I am now converted to TDD, I thought I’d look into BDD.

After scanning the net for a while, I finally found an introduction that I could understand. Here it is: [Introducing BDD](http://dannorth.net/introducing-bdd).

From what I understand, some colleagues implemented BDD with NUnit. You can read about it [here](http://blog.avegagroup.se/HakanAlexander/archive/2009/02/20/bdd-med-nunit.aspx) (in Swedish, I’m afraid), and also get some code that can help you create documentation similar to [AgileDox](http://agiledox.sourceforge.net/).

OK – the next thing to chew off… BDD looks cool.

**[UPDATED]** I have now read some more about BDD. Dan North, who wrote the article above, is considered the father of BDD, and that article is actually the birth of the subject. Pretty good introduction.

[Here](http://blog.wekeroad.com/mvc-storefront/kona-3/) is a video that has some nice examples and expands on the subject.
