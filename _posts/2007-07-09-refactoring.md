This is of course mega-old but here is a book tip: anyone interested in
creating good code should read
[Refactoring](http://martinfowler.com/books.html#refactoring) by Martin
Folwer.

This is great book on a subject that really can improve your output and
code quality. As an added bonus the book is written in easy accessible
way and with just the right amount of jokes and fun woven into it.

Read it! Now!
