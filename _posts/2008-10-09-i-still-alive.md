The blogging has been down to a minimum for the last couple of weeks.
This has to do with the current project being rushed to say the least.

But I am still alive and kicking! I'll try to do some work related
updates during the day. In my private life I can say that things are
really interesting:

-   Yesterday was release-party for the
    <a href="http://www.vasaband.se/wm07.php"
    target="_blank">Priority-CD</a> of the
    <a href="http://www.vasaband.se/" target="_blank">Vasa Band</a>.
    Very rewarding to finally see the great looking CD.
-   Tomorrow we'll be going on tour to the eastern part of Sweden
-   I (and Elin) took the leap and disassembled my <a

    target="_blank">IRiver to change battery</a>. That was as scary as I
    feared but now it's done.

I'll try to post some finding on MSBuild, PIAB and more as the day goes
along
