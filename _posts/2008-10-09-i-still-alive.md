The blogging has been down to a minimum for the last couple of weeks. This has to do with the current project being rushed to say the least.

But I am still alive and kicking! I'll try to do some work related updates during the day. In my private life I can say that things are really interesting:

- Yesterday was release-party for the [Priority-CD](http://www.vasaband.se/wm07.php) of the [Vasa Band](http://www.vasaband.se/). Very rewarding to finally see the great looking CD.
- Tomorrow we'll be going on tour to the eastern part of Sweden
- I (and Elin) took the leap and disassembled my [IRiver to change battery](https://www.marcusoft.net/2008/10/replacing-battery-of-h320.html). That was as scary as I feared but now it's done.

I'll try to post some finding on MSBuild, PIAB and more as the day goes along
