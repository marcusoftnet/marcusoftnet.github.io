We had
the Vasa Christmas Concert last night. It was a great night with full
hall (200 persons) and band, gospel choir and soloist in great form. All
in all we had a wonderful time and really felt that the Christmas is on
the way.

Today at 13,30 i am leaving for Gothenburg and the Lucia concerts there.
It will also be good but in a completely different way. Those concert a
much more professional in style and order. We're also doing the concert
three times which also is a bit special.

It will be fun though!
