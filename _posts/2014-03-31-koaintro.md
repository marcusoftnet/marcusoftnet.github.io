<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">

Ok, let's talk about
<a href="http://www.koajs.com/" target="_blank">KoaJs</a>. Why?
Well, it's new and shiny. But that's not it.
And it's tiny and stays out of your way. But that's not it.
It's created by the awesome
<a href="http://expressjs.com/" target="_blank">crew</a> behind
<a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2014/02/mnb-express.html"
target="_blank">ExpressJs</a> (and others). But that's not it.
It teaches me about new things. And really strange things. Like
generators for example. But that's not it.

No.

 I'm by no means a seasoned Javascript developer
but I'm already starting to dislike the code <a
href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2014/03/javascript-callbacks-cant-live-with.html"
target="_blank">callbacks</a> forces me to write. Yeah, I know, there
are ways around it with
<a href="http://www.promisejs.org/intro" target="_blank">promises</a>
and everything, but still have a hard time grasping that. Sorry. I hope
there's another way ^^

I mean; "<span
style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">getUserFromDatabase()</span>"...
what would you expect that to return? An user? Or a promise maybe? I
wouldn't think so either. I want the user, if you could please...

That said, I love the way that Node puts scalability first. To do that
we have (?) to  provide promises and callbacks. Or do we?
What if I said that you didn't? You could do without callbacks and
promises altogether. What if
<a href="http://koajs.com/" target="_blank">KoaJs</a>...?


Writing the code like you understand it.

Now, mind you (and me) well, that this is cutting edge stuff. This is
using proposed features of the next version of Javascript. So it's still
a bit rough around the edges. But the promise (pun intended) of getting
a nicer structure and get rid of the callbacks makes me tolerant.

I hope to be able to explain to you how it works and get your journey to
be a bit smoother than mine. In this post I just want us to get up and
running. And that's not as easy as one would first think.... The goal
today is to be able to run a few examples.

### Getting started

<div>

There's two parts to installing Koa; updating Node to the required
version and installing Koa. 

</div>

<div>

Most blog posts about Koa (and the KoaJs.com site itself) says something
like: "Koa needs Node 0.11.9 or higher to run". "Well thank you. I'm a
newbie at these things. How do I do that then?" was something i asked
myself.

Btw, this require that you have Node installed. If not you can go to
[www.nodejs.org](http://www.nodejs.org/) and hit the Install button to
get it on your system.

### Update Node, the safe way

</div>

<div>

The first thing I thought was "If I'll update my Node installation to
something bleeding edge... will the rest of my things work?" Luckily
there's a little nice tool that helps you with this. It's called
<a href="https://github.com/creationix/nvm" target="_blank">Node Version
Manager</a>, or nvm for short. 

</div>

<div>



</div>

<div>

Not only does this tool make it super easy to install new versions of
Node but also you can easily switch between versions, when you need to
"head back to safety". 

</div>

#### Install Node Version Manager

<div>

Installing the nvm by running the following command:

</div>

> <span
> style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; font-size: x-small;">sudo
> curl https://raw.github.com/creationix/nvm/master/install.sh \|
> sh</span>

This command pulls in the install.sh script form that url and executes
it. There's a number of things going on in the script, setting
path-variables etc. When it's done, and you have restarted the terminal
(?), you will have a couple of new commands at your disposal. You can
see them all by running "<span
style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">nvm
help</span>".

If that doesn't work out for you make sure to read the ReadMe (hmmm
wonder why it's called that :)) on the
<a href="https://github.com/creationix/nvm" target="_blank">nvm github
site</a>. There's a couple of manual tricks, adding stuff to the bashrc
(whatever that is) for example, that I needed to do to get this to work
on <a
href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2014/03/setting-up-complete-node-development.html"
target="_blank">one of my vm's</a>.

#### Installing a version of Node

<div>

One of those new commands is "nvm install". Let's do that now to get a
version that is needed for Koa (at least 0.11.9):

</div>

> <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">nvm
> install 0.11.9</span>

You can see the versions available for download by "<span
style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">nvm
ls-remote</span>", so you can pick a later version when this post is out
of date. Which in Javascript land is in about 20 minutes...

#### Using a version

<div style="text-align: left;">

We have now only installed a version and it's also set as our current
version. If you go "<span
style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">nvm
current</span>" you will see the version you are currently using. Or
have "loaded" if you want to.

</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">



</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">

If you want to use another version you just go "<span
style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">nvm use
0.10.8</span>" for example. But, Marcus, how can I see which versions of
Node I have installed then, you ask. Funny that you should ask that, he
responded with light laughter. That's simple

</div>

> <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">nvm
> ls</span>  

Will list the versions you have installed on your system, as well as
mark the one you are running in green. For the rest of this article make
sure that you have run "<span
style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">nvm use
0.11.9</span>" or higher than that.

### Installing Koa

<div>

That was the first part, preparing the way for installing Koa.
Thankfully that is much easier. It's really just a normal
<a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/koa" target="_blank">npm
package</a>. Let's be good programmers and set this up properly. Create
a new directory and call it <span
style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">KoaFirstStumblingSteps</span>
or something that describes what we are doing. cd into that directory
and then run "<span
style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">npm init</span>"
to get some nice
<a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2014/02/mnb-packagejson.html"
target="_blank">wizardry help to create the package.json</a>. 

</div>

<div>

When that is done you can go "<span
style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">npm install koa
--save</span>" to install koa in your directory and save the reference
in the package.json. 

</div>

<div>



</div>

<div>

Here's those steps in sequence:

</div>

<div>

-   <span
    style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">mkdir KoaFirstStumblingSteps</span>
-   <span
    style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">cd KoaFirstStumblingSteps</span>
-   <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">npm
    init</span>
-   \[a lot of questions that are quick to answer... Enter works for
    most of them. 0.45 sec to completion is my record\]
-   <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">npm
    install koa --save</span>

Alright. You should have seen quite a lot of things coming down with
that last command. I'll come back to that, but it has to do with Koa
believing very hard in modularity and composability. Or "it's made from
a lot of small Legos (c)", if you're a parent like me. 

</div>

<div>

We have set ourselves up for some Koa code. Let's dive right in. Create
a firstKoaSite.js file and ~~type the following~~ copy (who am I
kidding?) the following code into it:

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div>

I wanted to do something just a little more than a hello world and yet
not complicated at all. For this we need the "koa-route" middleware. No,
it's not included in Koa. Yes, middleware in Koa are tiny, so you end up
including many of them. 

</div>

<div>

Install with "<span
style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">npm
install koa-route --save</span>" and we are ready to run.
It's pretty self-explanatory and short and sweet. Just like we like
it:


-   Line 1,2 requires the things we need
-   Line 3 creates the actual Koa app
-   On line 8-9 we set up a couple of routes (via koa-route) using the
    <span
    style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">app.use()</span>
-   The routes calls out to a couple of functions. Note anything
    strange? Yes, the asterisk should be there. It's a generator
    function the
    <a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2014/03/koaGenYield.html"
    target="_blank">next post is about that. </a>
-   Finally on line 24 we fire the application up and shows how to call
    it

</div>

### Running your first Koa site

<div>

Running a Koa site is just starting it as normal with "<span
style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">node
firstKoaSite.js</span>" except it isn't... You need to add a flag to use
the "harmony"-features of Node. This is using some of the cutting edge
features of Javascript, normally not included. Like generators for
example, which Koa is built around. 

</div>

<div>



</div>

<div>

The complete command to run our first little site is in other words:

</div>

<div>

> <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">node
> --harmony firstKoaSite.js</span>

</div>

Exactly! I don't want to type that every time either... Better enter it
into the package.json, under scripts, and use
<a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/nodemon"
target="_blank">nodemon</a> so that we don't need to restart our server
manually on every change we make.
This is the scripts-node of my package.json.
<span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">
</span><span
style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">"scripts":
{</span>
<span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">  "start":
  "node_modules/nodemon/bin/nodemon.js --harmony
firstKoaSite.js"</span>
<span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">  }</span>

Which lets me start my site like this:

> <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">npm
> start</span>

Ahhh! Much better. And the site runs nice too. Looks like crap but
that's normal and expected for my sites. But with the proper indata
(http://localhost:3000/whosThere/World) you can get it to be a Hello
World application

> <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">Ah, it is
> you! My old friend!
> Hello World</span>

### Conclusion

<div>

This ends this first little post on Koa. I'm planning to write another
one to try to explain yield and generators. If for none other so for
myself. And then use more of Koa's features in some more sites. The goal
of this post was merely to get us off the ground.
