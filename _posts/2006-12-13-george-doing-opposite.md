I got
the Seinfeld-box from my sister in (a late) birthday present. There are
some great moments in there; this is when George starts doing the
opposite of everything he think is right ... with wonderful results -
everything starts to go right for him!!?






No worries though - in the next episode he is back like the loser we
love.
