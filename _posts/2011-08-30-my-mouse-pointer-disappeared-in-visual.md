I have started to use dark theme for Visual Studio. You know about the
site where you can get great themes, right? <http://studiostyl.es/>. I’m
using the [Son of
Obsidian](http://studiostyl.es/schemes/son-of-obsidian) theme right now,
but do check out [Coding Instinct
Theme](http://studiostyl.es/schemes/coding-instinct-theme) by my
colleague
<a href="http://www.codinginstinct.com" target="_blank">Torkel</a> .

However – one thing that really bugs me was that the mouse pointer when
in text edit mode (as it is in the code editor) goes to dark grey in the
standard theme for Windows 7 (and XP and Vista, I understand).

That was a very complicated sentence but basically – my mouse pointer
cannot be seen in the code editor. Very annoying.

I found the solution deep in a <a
href="http://weblogs.asp.net/infinitiesloop/archive/2006/08/06/Join-the-Dark-Side-of-Visual-Studio.aspx"
target="_blank">discussion here.</a> “for cursor, select a windows black
mouse scheme in control panel.”. That means the following – I didn’t
even know you could do this:

- Open Control panel
- Open Appearance and Personalization
- Open Personalization
- Finally – click Change mouse pointers. That will open this window:

- Select the Scheme called – Windows Black (system scheme)

This will turn the mouse pointer to a brighter color when going into a
black windows. I can see again!
