This spring there has been strikes for some groups of workers who
actually might need it; nurses for example. And right now, in the
beginning of the vacation times, the bus drivers of Stockholm has gone
on strike. This in turn leads to a lot more people in the subway and
commuter trains.

But we are still not even near an ordinary day in the Tokyo metro...
