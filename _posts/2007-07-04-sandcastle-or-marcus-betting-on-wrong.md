I read today about Sandcastle which is Microsoft's new documentation utility for .NET Framework 2.0 (<http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/bb608422.aspx>)

Soo - finally they have created a NDoc clone. I have been wondering why not NDoc has been upgraded to support .NET 2.0 but they probably knew that Sandcastle was coming along.

Also - I have been betting and introducing NDoc for .NET 2.0 (Alpha) in some of my build scripts. When Sandcastle finally arrive (CTP now so should take about a year) documentation generation will probably be done better with Sandcastle than with NDoc Alpha.

Hopefully this will give the NDoc guys some energy to start developing a final version for .NET 2.0. The alpha version is very good (no problems so far for me).
