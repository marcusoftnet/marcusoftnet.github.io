I read today about Sandcastle which is Microsofts new documentation utility
for .NET Framework 2.0
(<http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/bb608422.aspx>)

Soo -
finally they have created a NDoc clone. I have been wondering why
not NDoc
has been upgraded to support .NET 2.0 but they probably knew that
Sandcastle was coming along.

Also - i have been betting and introducing NDoc for .NET 2.0 (Alpha) in some of
my build scripts. When Sandcastle finally arrive (CTP now so
should take about a year) documentation generation will probably be done
better with Sandcastle than with NDoc Alpha.

Hopefully this will give the NDoc guys some energy to start
developing a final version for .NET 2.0. The alpha version is very good
(no problems so far for me).
