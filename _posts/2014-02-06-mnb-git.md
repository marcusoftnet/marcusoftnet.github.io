I'm writing down some of the things I've picked up when I started to
learn
about <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Node</a>, <a href="http://expressjs.com/" target="_blank">Express</a> and <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/" target="_blank">Mongo</a>.

This post is not at all about Javascript or Node. But rather about git,
that I use when doing Node...
I'm using [git](http://git-scm.com/) for source
control. That statement is more a less a given these days. Ha - long
gone are the days when this was a war. Git won and since I host my stuff
on <a href="http://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> too it's even
more compelling.

I've <a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2013/08/OssAtMs.html"
target="_blank">already written about</a> my small, but to me sufficient
knowledge about git, but I dare to repeat it here. I have actually got
by the last 3 years with just knowing 6-7 commands and understanding
some simple facts about the git architecture.

<a href="http://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git</a> is a distributed
source control system, meaning that every developer have a complete copy
of the repository. You clone the repository to get a local copy, of your
own. In addition Git uses a staging area in which you "compose" a commit
before you commit it into the repository. This concept is vital to
understand and not be confused by the git-way.

Speaking of the git-way... there are graphical tools. I don't use them.
The terminal makes me understand git much better and the visualisations
are often making me confused.

Here are all the commands I know and use:


-   <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">git
    -? and <span
    style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">git
    \[command\] -? - shows the help. And it's actually pretty
    good. <span
    style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">git branch
    -? for example
-   <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">git
    clone \[URL\] - creates a local copy of a repository that you
    can work in. Git adds a link back to the repository you cloned as a
    remote repository called "<span
    style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">origin".
    <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">git
    clone https://github.com/torvalds/linux.git for example
-   <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">git
    checkout \[branch\] - branches are lightweight in Git and you
    find yourself switching between them often. This command does
    exactly that. If you add a "<span
    style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">-b" to
    the command you create a new branch. This is useful when you start
    working on a new feature. <span
    style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">git checkout
    -b 'MyNewFeature' for example
-   <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">git add
    \[file\] and <span
    style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">git rm
    \[file\] - are commands that add and remove files to the
    staging area for your commit. With these command you build up your
    commit into a nice shape before you commit it into the repository.
    <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">git add
    --all adds all your changes
-   <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">git
    status - shows how your staging area looks right now. This is
    run often. Like a tick almost. 
-   <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">git
    commit -m '\[commit message\]' - commits the changes in your
    staging area into your repository. Commit often. Very often. <span
    style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">git commit -m
    'GetPersonFromDatabase test written'
-   <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">git push
    \[remote\] \[branch\] - this command pushes the committed
    changes in your branch to the remote. For example <span
    style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">git push
    origin MyNewFeature pushes the changes committed into the
    <span
    style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">MyNewFeature
    branch to the <span
    style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">origin repository.
-   <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">git
    merge \[branch\] \[branch\] - merges the changes in one
    branch into the other branch. <span
    style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">git merge
    master MyNewFeature merges the changes of <span
    style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">MyNewFeature
    into <span
    style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">master


The only thing I often need to look up is when you start locally and
then want to push it to a remote,
like <a href="http://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Often I
create an empty repository
at <a href="http://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> (great wizard
to do that at <a href="http://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>)
and then <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">git
clone<span style="font-family: inherit;"> that URL. But when I
haven't... I'm at a loss. So for me only; this is a workflow for
to start locally and then push
to <a href="http://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> (or another
remote).

First start as normal locally:


-   <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">git
    init - creates local git repository. 
-   do some initial work, like setting up the folder structure and the
    package.json
-   <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">git add
    --all - adds all the file to the staging area
-   <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">git
    commit -m 'Initial commit' - commits the change set to git. 

And ... here I'm stumped. Because I forgot to create a repository at
GitHub and then clone it. There's great help for how to fix this
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-remote"
target="_blank">here</a>. And here in short form:

-   Create repository
    at <a href="http://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>
-   Get the url to the repository, for example <span
    style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">https://github.com/marcusoftnet/
    TheNewProject.git
-   <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">git
    remote add origin https://github.com/marcusoftnet/
    TheNewProject.git  - to add a remote repository called origin
    to your local repository. When you first create it locally it
    doesn't have any remotes. Of course.
-   <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">git push
    origin master - to push your current master branch to the
    origin remote
    (aka <a href="http://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>). 


I hope you found this useful. I know that I will. This kind of knowledge
is what's fall out of my head quickly if I don't use it.
