I'm writing down some of the things I've picked up when I started to learn about [Node](http://nodejs.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), and [Mongo](http://www.mongodb.org/). Here are all the posts in the series:

- [Doing stuff in the terminal is not scary at all](http://www.marcusoft.net/2014/02/mnb-terminal.html)
- [`npm` is not only for getting packages](http://www.marcusoft.net/2014/02/mnb-npm.html)
- [Package.json is a mighty tool](http://www.marcusoft.net/2014/02/mnb-packagejson.html)
- Git is not that hard, but I need to refresh my knowledge - this post
- [Callback function is cool stuff, and I even know how to write them](http://www.marcusoft.net/2014/02/mnb-callbacks.html)
- [`mocha` is cool both as framework and test runner](http://www.marcusoft.net/2014/02/mnb-mocha.html)
- [`should` is a nice way to do asserts](http://www.marcusoft.net/2014/02/mnb-should.html)
- [`monk` is an easy way to access mongo](http://www.marcusoft.net/2014/02/mnb-monk.html)
- [Express is best without generators](http://www.marcusoft.net/2014/02/mnb-express.html)
- [supertest is a nice way to test an api](http://www.marcusoft.net/2014/02/mnb-supertest.html)

This post is not at all about Javascript or Node. But rather about git, that I use when doing Node...

I'm using [git](http://git-scm.com/) for source control. That statement is more or less a given these days. Ha - long gone are the days when this was a war. Git won and since I host my stuff on [GitHub](http://github.com/) too it's even more compelling.

I've [already written about](http://www.marcusoft.net/2013/08/OssAtMs.html) my small, but to me sufficient knowledge about git, but I dare to repeat it here. I have actually got by the last 3 years with just knowing 6-7 commands and understanding some simple facts about the git architecture.

[Git](http://git-scm.com/) is a distributed source control system, meaning that every developer has a complete copy of the repository. You clone the repository to get a local copy, of your own. In addition, Git uses a staging area in which you "compose" a commit before you commit it into the repository. This concept is vital to understand and not be confused by the git-way.

Speaking of the git-way... there are graphical tools. I don't use them. The terminal makes me understand git much better and the visualizations are often making me confused.

Here are all the commands I know and use:

- `git -?` and `git [command] -?` - shows the help. And it's actually pretty good. `git branch -?` for example
- `git clone [URL]` - creates a local copy of a repository that you can work in. Git adds a link back to the repository you cloned as a remote repository called "origin". `git clone https://github.com/torvalds/linux.git` for example
- `git checkout [branch]` - branches are lightweight in Git and you find yourself switching between them often. This command does exactly that. If you add a "-b" to the command you create a new branch. This is useful when you start working on a new feature. `git checkout -b 'MyNewFeature'` for example
- `git add [file]` and `git rm [file]` - are commands that add and remove files to the staging area for your commit. With these command, you build up your commit into a nice shape before you commit it into the repository. `git add --all` adds all your changes
- `git status` - shows how your staging area looks right now. This is run often. Like a tick almost.
- `git commit -m '[commit message]'` - commits the changes in your staging area into your repository. Commit often. Very often. `git commit -m 'GetPersonFromDatabase test written'`
- `git push [remote] [branch]` - this command pushes the committed changes in your branch to the remote. For example `git push origin MyNewFeature` pushes the changes committed into the `MyNewFeature` branch to the `origin` repository.
- `git merge [branch] [branch]` - merges the changes in one branch into the other branch. `git merge master MyNewFeature` merges the changes of `MyNewFeature` into `master`

The only thing I often need to look up is when you start locally and then want to push it to a remote, like [GitHub](http://github.com/). Often I create an empty repository at [GitHub](http://github.com/) (great wizard to do that at [GitHub](http://github.com/)) and then `git clone` that URL. But when I haven't... I'm at a loss. So for me only; this is a workflow for to start locally and then push to [GitHub](http://github.com/) (or another remote).

First start as normal locally:

- `git init` - creates local git repository.
- do some initial work, like setting up the folder structure and the package.json
- `git add --all` - adds all the files to the staging area
- `git commit -m 'Initial commit'` - commits the change set to git.

And ... here I'm stumped. Because I forgot to create a repository at GitHub and then clone it. There's great help for how to fix this [here](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-remote). And here in short form:

- Create a repository at [GitHub](http://github.com/)
- Get the URL to the repository, for example `https://github.com/marcusoftnet/TheNewProject.git`
- `git remote add origin <https://github.com/marcusoftnet/> TheNewProject.git` - to add a remote repository called origin to your local repository. When you first create it locally it doesn't have any remotes. Of course.
- `git push origin master` - to push your current master branch to the origin remote (aka [GitHub](http://github.com/)).

I hope you found this useful. I know that I will. This kind of knowledge is what's fall out of my head quickly if I don't use it.
