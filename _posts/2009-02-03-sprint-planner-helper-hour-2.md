OK - if you want to do DDD then you better start out with the Domain
Model. So today I created a Class Diagram for my domain. I also try to
follow the Extreme OOP rules and TDD (whooa - my head will explode) and
use them to guide me through the process.

OK - that was quite exciting. I am not done yet - but I got a first
domain-model up and running and started to mass produce unit tests.

I had some trouble with converting back to C# after two year in the
VB.NET swamp (Me/this for example) but that will soon be over. Also the
support in the studio is sooo much better for C#. I love it - this is
what Visual Studio was made for.

**\[UPDATED\]
**I moved the snippet for creating test methods to a post of it’s own.
You’ll find it
