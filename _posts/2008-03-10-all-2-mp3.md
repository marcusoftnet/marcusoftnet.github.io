I
for the first time in my life downloaded a little tool, loved it and
payed for it.

The name of the tool (and site is): [All To MP3
Converter](http://www.wma-mp3.com/)

This tool lets you convert different music formats from and to each
other. This is as easy as to right click a file and choose
convert. There is also a nice little GUI that does the same thing but
lets you decide more details.

It opened up about 100 WMA-files that I could listen to
since I am using [RockB<span
class="blsp-spelling-corrected">ox](http://www.rockbox.org/) on
my [H320 IRiver](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iriver_H300_series)
