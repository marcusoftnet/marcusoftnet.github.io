My corps (or church) has redone their [website](http://www.fralsningsarmen.se/vasakaren/). Actually, it's me who has added all the content. [The Salvation Army in Sweden](http://www.fralsningsarmen.se/) is using a content management tool called P3 that I am not too pleased about, but now it's done.

And I can add webmaster (or whatever it's called nowadays) to my CV. At least for a while.

Now go check out [Vasakåren online](http://www.fralsningsarmen.se/vasakaren/)
