My corps (or church) has redone their
<a href="http://www.fralsningsarmen.se/vasakaren/"
target="_blank">website</a>. Actually it's me who has added all the
content.
<a href="http://www.fralsningsarmen.se/" target="_blank">The Salvation
Army in Sweden</a> is using some content management tool (called P3)
that I not am too pleased about, but now it's done.

And I can put webmaster (or whatever it's called nowadays) in my CV. At
least for a while.

Now go check out <a href="http://www.fralsningsarmen.se/vasakaren/"
