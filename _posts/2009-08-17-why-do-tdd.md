I haven’t done
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development"
target="_blank">TDD</a> for a very long time and I still am waiting for
my first
<a href="http://dannorth.net/introducing-bdd" target="_blank">BDD</a>
project in real life. In fact I sometimes have a problem to describe the
goodness.

But <a href="http://railsenvy.com/" target="_blank">Gregg Pollack</a>
has done the same journey as I have and he has also done this great
presentation on why TDD is good and how to use it.

Sadly that video is long gone. Sad, because it was a good presentation.

This is such a great presentation where he takes us through a series of
points that explains the rationale of TDD and then BDD, or the “pathway
to developer enlightenment”, as he calls it. I have extracted his points
here:

1.  Testing breeds **confidence**
2.  If you write tests before you write your code, you end up **writing
    better code**
3.  Well written tests are just as good, if not **better than
    documentation**
4.  TDD isn’t about writing tests, it's **about defining behavior**.

Seeing this was like getting help to put words to my own thoughts. Thank

Also – I might have to check out
<a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/" target="_blank">Ruby</a>. To many
people has pointed towards it…
