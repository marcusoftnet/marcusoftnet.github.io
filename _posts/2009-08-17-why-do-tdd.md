I haven’t practiced [TDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) for a very long time, and I’m still waiting for my first [BDD](http://dannorth.net/introducing-bdd) project in real life. Sometimes, I struggle to articulate the benefits of these methodologies.

However, [Gregg Pollack](http://railsenvy.com/) has traversed this same path and has delivered a great presentation on the value of TDD and how to effectively use it. Unfortunately, the video is no longer available, which is a shame because it was an excellent presentation.

Gregg's presentation highlights several key points about TDD and BDD, which he describes as the "pathway to developer enlightenment." Here are the key points:

1. **Testing breeds confidence**
2. Writing tests before code results in **better code**
3. Well-written tests serve as effective **documentation**
4. TDD isn’t just about writing tests; it’s **about defining behavior**

Seeing these points articulated was like having my own thoughts validated. Thank you, [Gregg](http://railsenvy.com/2007/10/03/how-i-learned-to-love-testing-presentation).

Also, I might need to explore [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/). It’s been recommended by many people...
