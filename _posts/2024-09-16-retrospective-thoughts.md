I've just attended a discussion about process improvements in general and retrospectives specifically, together with a few ScrumMasters. I wanted to take the time to jot down some of the good ideas that popped up as we talked. 

## Blocked is status of work - not people

Being blocked is a status of a card (work item) - not a person. I've yet to meet a person that, when blocked on one work item, just sits down and do nothing. Most of us will pick up new work (thereby increaing work in progress) or switch to another task. 

Here's the thing; when you adopt a [focus on the flow](https://www.marcusoft.net/2017/02/comments-on-board-practices-6.html) of value, naturally you focus on the work. It is **work** that gets blocked. Work will not start working on something else, it will be blocked until we (or others) resolves it. Hence focusing on resolving the work that is blocked will naturally gather the team to help eachother and hence flow work smoother and faster. 

## Blockages are nuggest of improvement gold

Blocked items is an exception to how we want work to flow. [Waiting should not be a column](https://www.marcusoft.net/2014/05/waiting-should-be-note-and-not-column.html) in your process, but an exception. And in being that we should also be careful about collecting the reasons for the blockages. Blockages hold a story that we can use to ensure that it doesn't happen again, not so frequently or go to the root cause of the problem and maybe fix the larger problem to which our blockage was a symptom

## Retrospective is a great way to build a team

In a retrospective we invite critisim, improvement suggestions ([yes - changes](https://www.marcusoft.net/2013/10/YesITalkAboutChange.html)) and bringing up celebrations and problems. Allowing this to happen and taking responsiblity for trying to make it better is a way to build a team. 

Therefor be thoughtful of if/or when inviting outside people into your retrospectives - it's a safe space for the team to improve the team. It gells the team together into a well-functioning group that trust eachother and works together to a goal, i.e. a team. 

## One improvement is enough

Many retrospectives dies on the table since we come out with too many things to fix. Setting the goal of "one little thing that we can improve until the next retro" both sets the scope of the retrospective meeting and makes for an achieveable goal. 

It is much better to have one little improvment that we do do, than 15 totally awesome ideas that would change the world of computing that we never do. 

## Sphere of influence - zone of control

One of the most common problems I've seen that makes retrospective boring and irrelevant is that we try to affect things outside our sphere of influence. `If only the entire backend was rewritten as GraphQL` or `Someone should really change the way we do procurements` are maybe useful, but rarely something that an indivudal team can fix until the next retrospective. 

But it's a good start for what is really nagging us, maybe there's something that we can do something little about to make our lives better in there. Don't give up just because it's a big thing outside of our sphere of influnence, but think about what is in our zone of control. And make that change. 

## Summary

As I was taking these notes I was reminded of the motto of [Bob Bemer](https://www.marcusoft.net/2024/02/do-something-small-useful-now.html): 

```text
((((DO SOMETHING!) SMALL) USEFUL) NOW!)
```

It is not as snappy but here's a suggestion for a similiar thought about retrospectives: 

```text
((((HAVE RETROSPECTIVES) SHORT) FREQUENTLY) TO CREATES SMALL ACTIONABLE IMPROVMENTS) NOW)))
```

* `Have retrospectives` - like, at all
* `Have retrospectives short` - do them short
* `Have retrospectives short and frequently` - then you can run them frequently, rather than seldom
* `Have retrospectives short and frequently, to create small actionable improvments` - ensure that they create small improvements that we can do
* `Have retrospectives short and frequently, to create small actionable improvments now` - do it now. Just start. It's a good train, get on it.
