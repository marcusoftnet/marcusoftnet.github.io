Last week I tried to stay happy through the week no matter the
circumstances... Not sure it came of the way I hope. Not all days at
least.

I learned so far that you can get pretty far by just keeping your
spirits high. It can probably be a bit enjoying for your co-workers but
it will get you in a better mood. Also - forcing yourself to be happy
will take it's toll somewhere and I was completely exhausted this
Friday - not to good.

So this week I will do a combo - I'll try to be happy and take
assistance from a friend... that is: I'll start each half day with a
small prayer. This happen again and again. I always forget it. Here i
have a great resource of power and I fail to remember to use it. But now
i will remember.

"They will go forward in prayer"

I'll keep you posted.
