Today is the last day of work for me... for the summer. Now a wonderful
4 week period of doing nothing much is starting.

For me the summer holds the following:

-   First two weeks of vac cation in Croatia with Elin and my sister
    (the first week) which should be very nice. We're going to
    [Pula](http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?city=Pula&state=&country=croatia&size=big)
    but the plan is to go around and see other places. The main goal
    though is slow, nice and mind-winding vacation
-   Then home for a short while to wash up
-   The last part of the vacation is planned to be celebrated (yes,
    that's the word :)) on
    [Hypplen](http://www.hitta.se/ViewDetailsPlace.aspx?SearchType=4&wflWhite=1a1b&wflPink=4a&vad=&var=aspev%e4gen&StreetNumberId=102148838)
    in the Gothenburg archipelago.

So as you can see not much in there about computers, agile development
or euphoniums and brass bands. That's the whole idea! Vacation.

So i how that you all will have or are having a nice one too. See ya'll
in the autumn - I'll have some big news by then...
