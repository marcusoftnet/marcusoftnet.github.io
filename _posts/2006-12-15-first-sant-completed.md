Yesterday did my first Santa-performance!

Since it was on party for Elins workplace and didn't know anyone I was a bit nervous. Also they are nurses on a "urology"-department i was a bit nervous to read the rhymes on their present. :) And I was right - some of the rhymes had to do with the parts of the body that they work with. Nothing too bad though...

To the right is not a mugshot of someone robbing a bank, but rather me in the Santa outfit.
