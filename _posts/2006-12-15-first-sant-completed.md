Yesterday did my first Santa-performance!

Since it was on party for Elins workplace and didn't know anyone I was a
bit nervous. Also they are nurses on a "urology"-department i was a bit
nervous to read the rhymes on their present. :) And I was right - some
of the rhymes had to do with the parts of the body that they work with.
Nothing to bad though...
