I have been working as a contractor for the better part of my
career. Due to the nature of consultancy and the IT-business in general
I’ve seen a lot of colleagues come and go. Brilliant people in many
cases, people that you miss so bad when they have quit.
So when the ubiquitous “Thank you for the time here”-mail comes I always
try to write them a short sentence saying that I’ve really appreciated
their company, competence and just being around them.
And it hits me every time; why didn’t I say anything of this while we
were colleagues?
It’s so stupid. It’s so simple. And it takes
about 5 minutes to write. I always find the time when they send the
notice that they will quite.
So I will try this out – send people a “If you quit today … I would love
to have said this first”-note before they go. Yeah, yeah I know it
sounds like a New years resolution but I actually decided to do this in
November.
I found a great spot for doing it also. On the LinkedIn recommendation
page. Then it will be available for others to see as well. It might have
a twofold effect for the person in question.
Speaking of twofold this reminds me about a chours we sang in the
Salvation Army when I was small (my translation):

> Make someone happy
> Try to do it today
> There’s so many way you can try out
> And if you do it you will see
> That you’ll get happiness in giving
> So try today to make someone happy

I’ll give this a try. ~~Follow my tweets with the tag
“#IfYouQuitToday”.~~
After a great suggestion
from <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/chibbeu" target="_blank">Christer
Unestrand</a> I have now changed the twitter tag to
<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23HaveIToldYouLately"
target="_blank">"#HaveIToldYouLately"</a> since that's a more positive
take on it. Thanks Chibbe!
