I’m reading the excellent
<a href="http://heathbrothers.com/switch/" target="_blank">Switch: How
to Change Things When Change Is Hard</a>. And in it I stumbled on a
interesting story, and when I started to think about how it could be
applied in the Software development world I really got excited. But all
in due time. Here is the story, in my shortened and simplified form (be
sure to buy the book):

### BP

The example is taken from a chapter (4) called Point to the destination
that talks about good ways to show people where the goal is. Surrounding
this example they are talking about sending a postcard from the future;
Hey, look how warm and wonderful everything is here in the future when
we have changed all that stuff…

Then the authors gives an example from BP (Yeah, I know that might sit
bad with most people nowadays but forget the well in the Gulf for a
while). In 1989 BP was best of breed in drilling holes. They struck oil
in 1 of 5 holes they drilled, way better than the branch average of 1 of
8. But drilling oil wells are expensive… very expensive and they needed
to get better.

So to change that (record/attitude/fact) Ian Vann, the head of
explorations at the time, gave them a crystal clear goal: “No dry
holes!”.

Yes, that zero holes without oil is acceptable. Of course that sent
chock waves through the organization; “That cannot be done!”, “It’s just
ridiculous”, “Haha – well get back to the real world, for a while!”. But
after a while the people in the organization started to think about how
they could change their work to support that goal. “What could we do so
that no more dry holes appear?”, “What in our way of doing things is
making them drilling dry holes?”

And of course the story wouldn’t have been included in the book if BP
didn’t succeed. They drilled only 1 of 3 dry wells. And is not
satisfied. The relentless search for better results continue.

### Software

OK – what would be the equivalent to “No dry holes!” in the Software
business… Well that’s easy: “No more bugs!”

Here is my postcard from the future: It’s wonderful over here. The code
we’re writing is matching the requirements and doesn’t contain any
errors. Also the customer is always satisfied with all our releases.
Finally the application runs like a dream – it hasn’t been down in two
years…

And now I can almost hear you all: “That cannot be done!”, “It’s just
ridiculous”, “Haha – well get back to the real world, for a while!”.

Well that’s our goal!

-   How should we define bug? Right now it’s used as a work item tracker
    in many organizations.
-   What would have to be changed in your department to reach “No more
    bugs!”?
-   How would we have to change the way to cooperate with others to
    reach “No more bugs!”?
-   What would change in the way we write requirements, code, test,
    deploy to reach “No more bugs!”?

I thought that it was interesting to think about. And I realized that
we, at least, have much knowledge at our disposal. We know good ways to
write great code, we know good ways to cooperate around demands, etc.

But – WE DON’T DO THEM (amazingly?!). We have come to accept bugs as
part of the normal flow when creating systems. And we blame each other
for them… “If only the requirements have been clearer”, “Well, the
testers need to check that…”, “It doesn’t take longer to code right than
it takes to code wrong"

At Toyota they have as one of the pillars of the TPS respect for the
individual. One place where you can see this is when something goes
wrong; say that someone drops a piece on the floor. The Toyota way never
blames the individual worker – they blame the system. “What is wrong in
our process that make him drop that piece?”

What if;

-   we stopped to accept bugs as normal things
-   we stopped blame each other and looked to our process to find the
    problems
-   we, as a team, took responsibility of the whole process – instead of
    blame each other for problems in our small piece of the complete
    flow

Well, that’s just some thought that have been working in my brain this
morning.
