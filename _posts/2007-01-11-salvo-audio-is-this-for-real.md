Got a great tip yesterday about [Salvo
Audio](http://www.salvoaudio.com/) yesterday.

What a site! It contains tons of Salvation Army Brass band music, free
as it seems! So if you ever wondered how it sounds, or if you are
looking for CD's that is hard to find -
take a look here.

Great tip, Andreas! And keep a lookout for the Vasa Band (of Sweden) we try to
upload some stuff there.
