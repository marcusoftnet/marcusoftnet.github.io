Got a great tip yesterday about [Salvo
Audio](http://www.salvoaudio.com/) yesterday.

What a site! It contains tons of Salvation Army Brass band music, free
as it seems! So if you ever wondered how it sounds, or if you are
looking for <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" classCD's that is hard to find -
take a look here.

Great tip, Andreas! And keep a lookout for the Vasa Band (of Sweden) we try to
upload some stuff there.
