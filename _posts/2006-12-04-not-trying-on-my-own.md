After a
few weeks of trying to keep the happiness in top all by myself i am
stopping now; it seems as if that is not possible. And also as I wrote
in another post I've got a resource who can help me and also has
promised to be there for me always. That's Jesus - so from now on I'll
spend more time praying and thanking him for taking care of me although
i haven't cared to much about him at all times...

A strange calm comes over me when i think about that - i can just rest
in the knowledge that Jesus cares about me.
