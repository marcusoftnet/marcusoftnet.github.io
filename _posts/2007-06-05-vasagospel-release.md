Today i
will introduce a great choir when they release a new CD. They are
[VasaGospel](http://www.vasagospel.com/) and i am so proud to have a
choir like that in the ranks of our corps (church for all you
non-salvationists).

I have been a secret fan of them and have listen to some of their
earlier CD's and they really rock! If you ever get the opportunity to
hear them - don't miss it! Great singing, great band and some great
testimonies.

So - tonight they release their latest CD "In need". [Observatoriegatan
4,
Stockholm](http://www.hitta.se/SearchCombi.aspx?SearchType=4&wflWhite=1a1b&wflPink=4a&vad=&var=observatoriegatan+4+stockholm).
Don't miss it.

Also, another first for me - introducing a CD-release
