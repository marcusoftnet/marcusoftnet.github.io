When I first started to use [Koa Js](http://www.koajs.com/), I was, like many I presumed, slowed down by the fact that Koa is using features in JavaScript not yet released in the current Node, like [generators](http://www.marcusoft.net/2014/04/koaGenYield.html) for example.

When you're quite new to a subject, the errors that you are greeted with can be quite confusing. And the solutions are often not obvious. So, I did a short screencast showing off the failures that I ran into when I tried to get started with Koa. It's a tutorial through failures, quite simple.

I hope you enjoy it.

There are also some tips that have helped me in there. If you prefer reading about how to install this, it's basically the same content as [this blog post](http://www.marcusoft.net/2014/03/koaintro.html).

I used my iPhone mic this time and that took some of the clickety-click sounds away, even if it also made my voice a bit murky (if possible). Still no solution to improve the resolution. I have to look into that some more.
