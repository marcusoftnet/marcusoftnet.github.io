When I first started to use
<a href="http://www.koajs.com/" target="_blank">Koa Js</a>Â I was, like
many I presumed, slowed down by the fact that Koa is using features in
Javascript not yet released in the current Node. Like
<a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2014/04/koaGenYield.html"
target="_blank">generators</a> for example.

When your quite new to a subject the errors that you is greeted with can
be quite confusing. And the solutions are often not obvious. So I did a
short screencast showing off the failures that I ran into when I tried
to get started with Koa. It's a tutorial through failures, quite
simple.

I hope you enjoy it.

There are also some tips that have helped me in there. If you prefer
reading about how to install this it's basically the same content as
<a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2014/03/koaintro.html"
target="_blank">this blog post.</a>

I used my iPhone mic this time and that took some of the clickety-click
sounds away, even if it also made my voice a bit murky (if possible).
Still no solution to improve the resolution. I have to look into that
some more.
