Well, this is probably no news to people reading [4BarsRest](http://www.4barsrest.com/), but one of the most successful bands in later years (ever?) is being dis-assembled as we speak (?).

Since Sunday all of the key players and the conductor has left the band in a single file:

- [David King](http://www.4barsrest.com/news/detail.asp?id=4638) -conductor and primus motor for the band since 13 years
- [Sheona White](http://www.4barsrest.com/news/detail.asp?id=4643) - solo horn
- [Steven Walsh](http://www.4barsrest.com/news/detail.asp?id=4656) - solo euphonium, who by the way made the gutsiest move in the business by stepping up to take up the solo euphonium chair after Morgan Griffith. Respect!
- [Stuart Linguard](http://www.4barsrest.com/news/detail.asp?id=4662) - principal cornet

I can't imaging how the band has planned to cope with these problems but I hope they do! YBS stands for a quality above the rest and probably have improved the brass band movement as a whole with their performances. I, for one, has listen to some recordings of test pieces over a hundred times (yes, I am a nerd...)
