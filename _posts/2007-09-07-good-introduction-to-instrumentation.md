We'll adding instrumentation to our application but we lack
experience in the project. Google to the fore!

A quick search later and I found this good [introduction to
instrumentation](http://www.grimes.demon.co.uk/workshops/instrumentationWS.htm)
for .NET 2.0. I haven't read it all yet but it looks pretty extensive
and to be written in a nice comprehensive manner.
