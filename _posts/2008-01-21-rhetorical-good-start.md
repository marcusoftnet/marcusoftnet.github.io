I've
always been fascinating on how to do a good presentation or how to
persuade an audience. My usual way to do this is to study the subject
and to get a good feel about it - I know that I am much better on topics
i really have a passion for. And then I often spoils the whole thing by
taking to much or to fast.

But here are, in Swedish, a very good site for people like me, who might
need a brushing in the theoretical way of how to
construct a good presentation:
