Every Monday morning I usually listens
to the last broadcast of [Listen to the
band](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/aod/networks/radio2/aod.shtml?radio2/listenband).
This week there are some serious playing going on... Grimethorpe and
Black Dyke.

This is very, very good playing indeed - and live. Don't try this a home
kids... Please keep all limbs inside the computer until it has come to a
complete stop. :)

It's out for a week. Don't miss the chance to hear some great playing.
