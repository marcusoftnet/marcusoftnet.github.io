As I've [written
before](http://marcushammarberg.blogspot.com/2007/06/refactoring-support-for-vb.html)
the <span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_0"
class="blsp-spelling-error">refactoring support in Visual
Studio 2005 is non-existing (or at least very very
bad) for Visual Basic.

So we have to settle with third party products. The best <span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">I've found
is Refactor! but it's not very
good either (my studio hangs from time to time after <span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_4" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">installing
Refactor!).

But now there are new hopes; a new version of <span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_6" class="blsp-spelling-error">Refactor! is highlighted when
the studio is started. Download the new [version
here](http://downloads.devexpress.com/IDETools/VB/RefactorVB.NET-2.5.0.exe)
for free and see a [movie about its use
here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdntv/episode.aspx?xml=episodes/en/20060608vbasicjs/manifest.xml).

Refacator! still has the coolest GUI
<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_5" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">I've
seen for a long time. Not that usable maybe but cool.

I am keeping my fingers crossed for the product to be better than
earlier versions... which is pretty hard when you are programming ;)
