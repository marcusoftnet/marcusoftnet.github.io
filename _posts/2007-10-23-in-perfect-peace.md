The last thing the <span>="blsp-spelling-error">Gothenburg</span> Brass band did before the
stopped playing was go on a tour in England. On the tour the found time
to record a CD and take part in the European Championships.


I got the great <span>="blsp-spelling-corrected">privilege</span> to write the inlet of
the CD, which is called In Perfect Peace after one of the pieces on the
CD. That particular piece is written by Kenneth <span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-error">Downie</span> and was
very important for the band and Bengt <span>="blsp-spelling-error">Eklund</span>. So it's very fitting that the
last CD is called that and that the piece is on it.

About a week ago i found the CD in the catalog from [World of
Brass](http://www.worldofbrass.com/)... Made me very proud. It'll be the
first time i am published in such a way.
