The last thing the Gothenburg Brass band did before the
stopped playing was go on a tour in England. On the tour the found time
to record a CD and take part in the European Championships.


I got the great privilege to write the inlet of
the CD, which is called In Perfect Peace after one of the pieces on the
CD. That particular piece is written by Kenneth Downie and was
very important for the band and Bengt Eklund. So it's very fitting that the
last CD is called that and that the piece is on it.

About a week ago i found the CD in the catalog from [World of
Brass](http://www.worldofbrass.com/)... Made me very proud. It'll be the
first time i am published in such a way.
