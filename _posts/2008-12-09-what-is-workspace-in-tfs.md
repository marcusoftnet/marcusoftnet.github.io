This question has puzzled me for quite some time. It's so vague and
fluffy in the edges. However here is a
<a href="http://www.woodwardweb.com/teamprise/000333.html"
target="_blank">great article</a> that describes what it is - and I am
so relieved that I wasn't completely stupid.

The term is quite fluffy and can be described as "the things a user work
with on a local computer". Or to put it more elegantly, as Martin
Woodward does, "a container that bridges the gap between your local
computer (acting as a TFS client) and the server"
