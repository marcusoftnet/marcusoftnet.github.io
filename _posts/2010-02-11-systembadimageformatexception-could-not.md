I ran into this problem when I tried to re-open a <a
href="https://www.marcusoft.net/2009/09/automapping-with-fluentnhibernate.html"
target="_blank">solution I did a while back</a> when labbing with Fluent
<a href="https://www.hibernate.org/343.html"
target="_blank">NHibernate</a> and SQLite.

Behind the cryptic error message lies and easy solution; I was running
the 32-bit version of the SQLite-driver and runtime. That' doesnâ€™t fly
on my Windows 7 64-bit machine.

Here is a more <a

target="_blank">through description</a> and here is a link to
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sqlite-dotnet2/files/"
target="_blank">the latest version of SQLite</a> that will get you all
the version (32 and 64 bits) of the SQLite.
