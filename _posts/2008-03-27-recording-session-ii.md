Yesterday
evening was the last rehearsal before the second and last recording
session with my band, the Vasa Band.

We are really in a flow right now; we feel blessed and that God is with
us in our efforts and the playing standard is on very high level.

I am really looking forward to the weekend which will be great fun and a
lot of hard work. The pieces we are going to record are:

-   I Surrender All - a cornet solo by Andreas Holmlund
-   Priority - a "major" piece by Anders Beijer
-   Swing the pearly gates - swing piece (duh!) by Andreas Holmlund
-   Kan Kristus r√§kna med dig - another swing piece by Andreas Holmlund
-   Journey into Peace - euphonium solo by William Himes
-   Hawthorne march - a march from the 1920's

I am really proud of the band and i am sure that this will be great.
