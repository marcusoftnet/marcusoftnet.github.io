I received a question from three colleagues about what [Twitter](http://twitter.com) is and how to use it. While I don’t consider myself an expert, I use Twitter frequently and have compiled an introductory guide with my own tips on how to navigate it. There are other resources available, such as this one by [Scott Hanselmann](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/HowToTwitterFirstStepsAndATwitterGlossary.aspx), but here’s my take on it.

### What is Twitter?

According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter):

> **Twitter** is an online [social networking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network_service) and [microblogging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microblogging) service that enables its users to send and read text-based posts of up to 140 [characters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(computing)), informally known as "tweets."

You send short messages (tweets) that are visible to anyone who follows you. You can also follow other users to receive their updates. Most of the content is public (with some exceptions like direct messages) and can be viewed by visiting [your Twitter page](http://twitter.com/marcusoftnet). That’s the basic idea, but there’s more to it than meets the eye.

### Common Twitter Conventions

Due to the 140-character limit, several conventions have emerged to communicate more efficiently:

#### `#` – Hashtags

A hashtag (e.g., #avegaConference) categorizes your tweet and makes it discoverable by others interested in the same topic. For instance:

> If you’re at a large conference, you might use a tag like #oredev or #javaZone2011 in your tweets. This allows others searching for that tag to find your tweets and join the discussion.

Popular tags can be tracked using services like [Trendistic](http://trendistic.indextank.com/), which helps you stay updated on trending topics. For example, during the Egyptian revolution, the tag #tahrir was widely used.

#### @\[Twitter Username\]

Mentioning a user involves placing an @ symbol before their username (e.g., [@marcusoftnet](http://twitter.com/marcusoftnet)). This can notify the user and allows for direct interaction:

> If I tweet: “Saw [@hugohaggmark](http://twitter.com/hugohaggmark) eating at Vapiano today,” everyone who follows me will see it. But if I tweet: “[@hugohaggmark](http://twitter.com/hugohaggmark) do you want to join me at Vapiano today?” it will be visible to both Hugo and anyone who follows both of us.

#### RT – Retweet

A retweet is when you share someone else’s tweet with your followers. Simply start your tweet with RT and include the original tweet:

> For example, if [@hakanforss](http://twitter.com/#!/hakanforss) tweets: “Don’t forget Lean Coffee tomorrow at Le Café,” I can retweet it as: “RT @hakanforss - Don’t forget Lean Coffee tomorrow at Le Café.”

This mechanism helps information spread rapidly across Twitter.

#### Smiles and Abbreviations

Emoticons and abbreviations add emotion and brevity to tweets:

- :) – Happy
- :( – Sad
- ;) – Winky, ironic
- FTW – For the win

#### Replies

When replying to a tweet, use the Reply function to keep the conversation organized. This creates a thread so you can follow the conversation chronologically:

#### DM – Direct Message

Direct messages are private messages that only you and the recipient can see. Start your tweet with “DM” followed by the recipient’s username:

> For example, “DM @attefall Isn’t this meeting boring? And it smells unpleasant :(” will only be visible to you and @attefall.

Be cautious with DMs as it’s easy to forget they’re private.

### Integration with Other Networks

Twitter can integrate with other social networks. For instance, my tweets appear on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com). Services like [SelectiveTweets](http://www.facebook.com/selectivetwitter) can publish tweets with specific tags (e.g., #fb) to [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/). Additionally, many sites now allow login via Twitter.

### How to Use Twitter

Here are my personal tips on using Twitter:

- **Let it Flow**: Don’t stress about reading every tweet. Twitter is often referred to as “The River of Crap” — it’s okay to miss some tweets.
- **Follow What Interests You**: Curate your feed by following accounts that you find interesting. Unlike Facebook, you don’t need to follow back.
- **Explore Tags**: Start by checking out interesting hashtags and share your opinions. It’s a great way to get involved.
- **Manage Information**: Use hashtags and saved searches to keep up with topics of interest. Twitter is a fast way to stay informed.
- **Take Breaks**: Turn off notifications when focusing on tasks that require concentration.
- **Be Polite**: Remember that most of your tweets are public. Share only what you’d be comfortable saying in person.

### Conclusion

This guide offers a basic introduction to Twitter and tips for making the most of it. Used wisely, Twitter can be a powerful source of news and information.

I hope this helps, especially for Ulrica and friends! 😊
