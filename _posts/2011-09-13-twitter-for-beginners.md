I got a question from 3 colleagues on what
<a href="http://twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter</a> is and how we
should use it. I don’t claim to be an expert but I use it quite a lot
everyday. So here is my introduction to Twitter – with my own opinions
on how to use it. There are <a
href="http://edweb.sdsu.edu/courses/edtec570/spring09/activities/opd/twitter.htm"
target="_blank">other introductions</a>, like this by <a
href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/HowToTwitterFirstStepsAndATwitterGlossary.aspx"
target="_blank">Scott Hanselmann</a>, of course – but since they asked I
might as well put it up here.

#### What is it?

From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"
target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> we learn that:

> **Twitter** is an online [social
> networking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network_service) and
> [microblogging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microblogging) service
> that enables its users to send and read text-based posts of up to 140
> [characters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(computing)),
> informally known as "tweets."

So you send short messages (tweets) that is picked up by anyone who
follows you. You can follow a number of people to subscribe to their
updates. Everything is public (almost see DM below) and can be viewed by
anyone by going to
<a href="http://twitter.com/marcusoftnet" target="_blank">your
Twitter-page</a> – that’s basically it.

But as with many simple things there are much more than meets the eyes.

#### What does X means?

Since the text messages only allow for 140 characters there are a few
conventions and tricks that are used to communicate intent and more
information in that short space. Here are few of them:

##### \# – hashtag (or tags for short)

By writing a tag (#avegaConference for example) in your tweet other
people can pick up what you have to say in a subject. Also you can easy
follow the discussion going on for that tag. An example might clarify
the use a bit:

> Say that you are at a big conference with hundreds of other people. Of
> course you don’t follow all of them. That’s very impractical. But the
> conference might use a certain tag (#oredev, \#javaZone2011 etc) and
> by including that tag in your message this can be picked up by other
> that search for that tag in all tweets.

You can find the most popular tags by
<a href="http://trendistic.indextank.com/" target="_blank">searching for
trending topics</a> actually that’s a great way to keep up-to-date with
important topics. The revolution in Egypt for example used \#tahir (if I
remember correctly) to collect all tweets about the event at Tahir
Square.

##### @\[a Twitter user name\]

When you mention a Twitter user you write the @-sign followed by the
twitter name (aka Twitter handle) for that user;
<a href="http://twitter.com/marcusoftnet"
target="_blank">@marcusoftnet</a> to mention me for example. Most
Twitter client applications can inform you on all the times somebody has
mentioned you.

As special case of mentioning is to write the user name first in your
tweet. That means that you direct the message to that user. It’s visible
to that person and all the persons following both you and the person you
mention.

So for example if I tweet:

> “Saw <a href="http://twitter.com/hugohaggmark"
> target="_blank">@hugohaggmark</a> eating at Vapiano today. Again!”

Everybody who follows me will see that tweet and know about Hugos lunch
business. But if I instead write:

> [“@hugohaggmark](mailto:“@hugohaggmark) do you want to tag along to
> Vapiano today? Again.”

Hugo will see this, but also the people who follow both me and Hugo.

Using this technique you can direct a message to anyone with a twitter
account (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/BarackObama"
target="_blank">@barackObama</a> for example).

##### RT - retweet

A retweet is simply repeating what somebody else has said. This is the
reason that news and other information can travel very, very fast on
Twitter .

You simple start your tweet with RT and then a copy of the tweet you are
re-tweeting. Most client application has built-in functionality to do
this for you.

For example, if <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/hakanforss"
target="_blank">@hakanforss</a> tweets this noteworthy information:

> “Don’t forget Lean Coffe tomorrow at Le Café”

Everybody that follows Håkan will see this. Including me, since I follow
Håkan. So I can simply re-tweet that information to all the people who
are following me, by tweeting:

> [“RT @hakanforss](mailto:“RT@hakanforss) - Don’t forget Lean Coffe
> tomorrow at Le Café”

With this simple mechanism we have now shared this information with
hundreds of users, who in turn can retweet it. It’s an information
sharing avalanche that cannot be stopped.

##### Smiles, abbreviations etc

Smiles and other abbreviations are plentiful. I would stick to a few
since not many are well known. Here are a few that I use:

- :) – I’m happy, that was fun
- :( – I’m sad, sadly etc
- ;) – pun intended, irony
- FTW – for the win and exclamation of triumph (#specflow \#ftw)

##### Replies

If you reply to a tweet be sure to the Reply-function. Doing so give
Twitter a chance to keep a nice thread going for you so that you can see
the conversation in chronological order. Here is one example from the
Twitter website:

[<img

data-border="0" width="211" height="294" alt="twitter reply chain" />](http://lh5.ggpht.com/-pEB0p9BmEBw/Tm-mzblgjNI/AAAAAAAABCg/Vu0mJIbSd-Y/s1600-h/twitter%252520reply%252520chain%25255B6%25255D.png)

####  

##### DM – direct message

You can send private messages to someone you follow and who follows you.
Start your tweet with “DM” and only you two will see the message. For
example:

> [“DM @attefall](mailto:“DM@attefall) Isn’t this one boring meeting?
> And it stinks from the person next to me :(”

That will not be picked up by anyone else. I would still use this
function with care. It’s all too easy to forget the DM…. And if other
people in the meeting, in my example follows you… You get the picture.

#### Integration with other social networks

Most other social networks can import your tweets. Mine show up on
<a href="http://www.linkedin.com" target="_blank">on LinkedIn</a> for
example.

I have also hooked up a nice service called
<a href="http://www.facebook.com/selectivetwitter"
target="_blank">SelectiveTweets</a> that publish any tweets I do which
include the tag “#fb” to
<a href="http://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank">Facebook</a>.

There are numerous applications that can use the tweets you send (if you
grant permissions of course) to
<a href="klout.com/#/marcusoftnet" target="_blank">do all kind</a>
<a href="http://twournal.com/" target="_blank">of fun stuff</a>.

More and more site allow you to sign in using your Twitter-account as
well.

#### How do I use it?

Finally my own opinions on how to use Twitter.

- First and foremost – let it wash over you. Don’t try to read every
    single tweet. Twitter has been called “The River of Crap” :). So if
    you don’t read for a day or two – no sweat. Pick up where you are
    now.
- Follow people that YOU think are interesting. You are putting your
    information feed together for you. Most twitter users don’t get
    upset if you don’t follow them back – as has been know to happen on
    Facebook.
- Get started by checking out some interesting tag and start to add
    your opinion on them. Soon you’ll be hooked too.
- I have few hashtags and saved searches that I use to keep myself
    informed on certain areas. Great for keeping up to date – you can’t
    get information faster.
- TURN IT OFF – when doing work that requires your concentration.
- Be polite – remember that most of the things you write are
    publically accessible. I don’t tweet stuff that I cannot say to
    someone’s face or in public.

#### Conclusion

There you have my short introduction to Twitter and how to use it. Used
right it can be a great source to news and information.

I hope you found useful. At least you Ulrica and friends <img
