no secret that I like the writings (and presentations) of
<a href="https://twitter.com/ldavidmarquet" target="_blank">Captain
David Marquet</a>.  If you haven’t
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqmdLcyES_Q"
target="_blank">seen this video do that instead of reading this</a>. It
change a whole lot about how I look at leadership.
One of the
<a href="http://davidmarquet.com/books/turn-the-ship-around/overview/"
target="_blank">best tips in the book</a> is the small imperative
sentence:

> Move the authority to the information!

However, often when I explain this to people and clients I often end up
adding the opposite to this sentence. From that I got some interesting
conversations going.
Let’s see if I can explain what I mean here.
With the added continuation (that, to my
recollection is not is in the book) would make the quote like this:

> Move the authority to the information *instead of the opposite; move
> the information to the authority.*

What caught my attention was how much time, money, systems and pain we
go through to move information to the authority.

most (hierarchical) organizations I have been involved in there’s also
been some kind of unspoken rules, or hidden policies that the woman at
the top (or at least above you) should know everything that the people
below knows. I even heard managers air their dissatisfaction to their
staff: “How do you expect me to make good decisions if you don’t tell me
everything?! You need to let me know people!” (Nice blaming other
tactics going on there as well).
It’s correct though. If the man at the top should call the decisions we
need to get the information to him. Or he will make uninformed
decisions. Of course.
Sadly that will not happen. The person on top will never know enough, or
at least as much as people closer to the information. We could probably
prove that with physics if we wanted to. I think.
What, in my experience, will happen in hierarchical organizations like
that is that information get lost, get distorted, is not reported in
full or changed and tweaked to suit the needs of the sender. Maybe you
are scared to report bad news, maybe you forgot things that would have
been important, maybe you couldn’t know what part of the information was
needed to make a good decision.
Also, there’s a higher chance of lack of other things such as
commitment, ownership, responsibility, innovation and ambition. In my
experience.

## What if…

So, if we were to try the idea and advice of Captain Marquet and “move
the authority to the information”. What differences will that make?

### Cheaper

it is cheaper. It’s all about letting go of control and structure. I
didn’t say “Loose control” but letting go of the current systems and
pursue a new, better version where authority is closer to the
information. Would you rather make a decision with more or less
information? You can control this dial too.
In the book “Turn the ship around” they changed the communication route
from “Do this!” to “I intend too”. A subtle but important change. In
this way the initiative doesn’t come from above, but rather the people
close to the information comes up with the ideas and innovations and
informs the levels above. The people close to the information is of
course guided by the overarching goal, and communicating this is the
main task of the “management” / leadership.

### Simpler

Secondly, it’s simpler. The information is already there and known.
Moving authority is “just” a policy change (more that “just” later)
where no new information pushing system or policy needs to be in
place.

### Better for our customer

imagine explaining the two approaches to one of your paying customer.
Yes, you know who I mean, the ones paying your salary.
Would you feel more proud, comfortable and get the customers approval
for the well-thought out and working system for moving information to
the authority, that gives excellent control of the process and the
information in it?
Or would it feel better to show the customer how you’re spending his
money doing stuff faster, by letting people who actually do things make
more decisions as they need?
I have never, but this is only my experience, heard about any company
that got cheers, pat on back or any kind of good reaction about their
well-structured organization chart or the strict control of decisions.
From outside customers I mean. From board members and others I’ve heard
that. And from people within the organization.
Customers, or the-ones-paying-our-bills as you can refer to them, are
interested in the output of our system (aka the organization). HOW we
organize… not really important to them. “Do whatever you have to, to
keep being great and keep being around”, seems to be their motto. Maybe
they have a point. What do you think?
I think organization is the living thing, the best-so-far, that we
hopefully soon will change to something faster, simpler and more
pleasant to work in. Oh, speaking of that.

### Motivating our guys

Finally, a lot of good things and behaviors will emerge from doing this.
We can actually copy the list with what you will lack and loose in a
strict hierarchical organization, and restate it again, with one small
change:

> “higher chance ~~of lack~~ of other things such as commitment,
> ownership, responsibility, innovation and ambition”

In the good old days we called this
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empowerment"
target="_blank">empowerment</a>, but sadly that word has been abused a
lot. Empowerment without autonomy and authority to change your situation
is pretty much … not empowerment.
In reality though empowerment is exactly what we’re doing when moving
the authority to the information; handing down operation power to lower
level. They don’t act totally random though; with good leadership and
well communicated goals and direction they, to quote Captain Marquet
again:

> Act as if the manager/leader was standing behind them.

## Objections

I already hear some objections to this. Let me air mine first and then
we can continue in the comments below.

### That did not happen…

It’s been pointed out to me from several sources that Captain Marquet
story is to good to be true. Maybe it’s been painted prettier than it
actually was, or at least how it spread within the navy. I don't believe
that for a second but here’s the thing:

> I don’t know. I don’t care.

I took that very inspirational story as just that; inspiration. Even if
it was entirely made (which it is NOT) up I think it still has great
points and things to teach me.
I will not implement it exactly as he did anyway. To quote another
captain;

> … the code is more what you'd call "*guidelines*" than actual
> *rules*
> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0325980/quotes?item=qt0416601"
> target="_blank">Captain Barbosa, Pirates of the Caribbean</a>

### That will not happen…

I agree. And this is where I get sad. People are more reluctant to let
go of power than anything else I’ve seen. Even money. I have heard
people chose to lower their paycheck but keep authority.
So that’s it then. No more of this. It ends in a
<a href="http://sadtrombone.com/?play=true" target="_blank">big sad
trombone</a>?
I don’t think so. Firstly I think this is worthy pursuing and striving
towards. You don’t (and maybe never should) turn the dial all the way to
11, with all decisions been made out there (<a
href="http://flowchainsensei.wordpress.com/2011/03/03/rightshifting-transitions-part-3/"
target="_blank">chaordic organization/mindset</a> I think its called).
<a
href="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1074301/Valve_Handbook_LowRes.pdfe%20people%20have%20tried%20and%20succeed"
target="_blank">Some people have tried and succeed</a>, go ahead and
explore your possibilities.
Secondly, doing this to an existing organization is much harder than
starting from fresh. Trust me, I work (well ok… not really,
<a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2013/06/moving-to-indonesia.html"
target="_blank">I’m on leave right now</a>) for
<a href="http://www.aptitud.se/" target="_blank">Aptitud</a>. Let me, to
end this finally tell you all little bit about how we decide things at
Aptitud.
Here are our decision making rules;

> If the decision is small – just do it already, if you think it’s
> useful
> If the decision is a bit bigger – discuss it with any colleague. If
> you end up thinking it’s a good idea – just go!
> If the decision is really big – involve more people. Maybe take it up
> on one of our biweekly company meetups. If you think its good – run
> with it.  

> What’s big and what is small? You decided. We trust you. And all the
> information (invoices, expenses and salaries etc.) is shared among
> everyone in the company anyway so…

Not so hard right? Simpler, cheaper, more motivating and better for our
customers that doesn’t have to pay for our overhead to move information
to the authority. We have *moved the authority to the information
instead of the opposite*.
Works for us. How will you make it work for you?
