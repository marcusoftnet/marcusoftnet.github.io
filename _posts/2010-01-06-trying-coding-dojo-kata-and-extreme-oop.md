In preparations for a presentation next week (which will go on for two
days… brrr) I had my sights set on doing something about
<a href="http://milano-xpug.pbwiki.com/f/10080616-extreme-oop.pdf"
target="_blank">Extreme OOP</a> or <a
href="http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2008/11/06/object-calisthenics-first-thoughts/"
target="_blank">Object Calisthenics</a>. I’m thinking of using that
exercise to illustrate some OOP practices.

In the
<a href="http://milano-xpug.pbwiki.com/f/10080616-extreme-oop.pdf"
target="_blank">PDF-file for the Extreme OOP</a> above you’ll find an
excellent kata (the Commodore 64 kata) that will take you through all
the rules of Object Calisthenics.

OK – but since I didn’t wanted to do that exercise all of my own I
hooked up with two
<a href="http://www.avegagroup.se" target="_blank">Avega</a> colleagues
(David Blomberg and Magnus Forberg, great guys!) and we did some kind of
coding dojo.

The findings was quite surprising.

-   First – the rules of Object Calisthenics are not be followed when
    you do ordinary code. It’s simply an exercise to get you to think
    about OOP in a very structured fashion.
-   Secondly – the rules are very hard to follow… Very hard. We didn’t
    get quite there I felt.
-   Thirdly – the main take-away for me was that you learn so very much
    by doing pair programming and
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development"
    target="_blank">TDD</a> together. It’s simply the best way to code
    in my opinion. The amount of information that is transported back
    and forth for each code line is immense. I almost don’t dare to do
    code on my own ;)
-   Fourth – just by sitting next to another person coding is a great
    learning experience. Shortcuts, patterns, tricks and structuring
    solutions – everything you can think of. And it sticks.

So – I still think the exercise was good – but it didn’t get to what I
thought and I learned a lot of stuff that I didn’t thought either. Thank
you guys.
