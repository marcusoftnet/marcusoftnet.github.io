In preparation for a presentation next week (which will go on for two days… brrr), I had my sights set on doing something about [Extreme OOP](http://milano-xpug.pbwiki.com/f/10080616-extreme-oop.pdf) or [Object Calisthenics](http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2008/11/06/object-calisthenics-first-thoughts/). I’m thinking of using that exercise to illustrate some OOP practices.

In the [PDF file for the Extreme OOP](http://milano-xpug.pbwiki.com/f/10080616-extreme-oop.pdf) above, you’ll find an excellent kata (the Commodore 64 kata) that will take you through all the rules of Object Calisthenics.

OK – but since I didn’t want to do that exercise all on my own, I hooked up with two [Avega](http://www.avegagroup.se) colleagues (David Blomberg and Magnus Forberg, great guys!) and we did some kind of coding dojo.

The findings were quite surprising.

- First – the rules of Object Calisthenics are not meant to be followed when you do ordinary code. It’s simply an exercise to get you to think about OOP in a very structured fashion.
- Secondly – the rules are very hard to follow… Very hard. We didn’t get quite there, I felt.
- Thirdly – the main takeaway for me was that you learn so very much by doing pair programming and [TDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) together. It’s simply the best way to code in my opinion. The amount of information that is transported back and forth for each code line is immense. I almost don’t dare to code on my own ;)
- Fourth – just by sitting next to another person coding is a great learning experience. Shortcuts, patterns, tricks, and structuring solutions – everything you can think of. And it sticks.

So – I still think the exercise was good, but it didn’t get to what I thought, and I learned a lot of stuff that I didn’t expect either. Thank you, guys.
