A
friend and colleague (and current project
member, actually) has created a game on the XNA platform. The game has been
competing in various contests but is now nominated to [.NET
Awards](http://www.lidberg.se/awards/award.html), which is the arguable
most prestigious award in the Microsoft community in Sweden.

The game is called [Bullet Hell Tactics](http://shmup.blogspot.com/) and
is great fun. Please download a try out version and then vote, vote,
vote for Jens ([Team Shmup](http://shmup.blogspot.com/))
and his game on the .NET Award site
