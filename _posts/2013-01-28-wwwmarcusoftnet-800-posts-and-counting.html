<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I've just published my <a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2013/01/pickles-generate-specflow-documentation.html" target="_blank">800th post</a>!<br /><br />Can't really understand that. I know that <a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2006/10/eating-my-mobile-and-nanbread.html" target="_blank">some of them </a>haven't been<a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2006/10/i-like.html" target="_blank"> all that great</a> but there's some nuggets of information in there. At least for me.<br /><br />That's how I <a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2006/10/marcus-on-net.html" target="_blank">started to blog</a>: to make myself write stuff down to remember and formalize my knowledge.<br /><br />800 posts, six years, 163 000 pageviews. That's not a lot for many blogs out there but it means a lot to me.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my blog. Even though I started to write it for myself - comments and reactions is &nbsp;what kept me going on for 6 years! I cannot promise 6 more but right now I'm on a roll.&nbsp;</div>
