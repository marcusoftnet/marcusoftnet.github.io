Throughout all the things I've talked about in this series; mission, vision, strategic plans and kanban there's a underlying concept. We want to improve. We want to be better in achieving our vision. 

If you want to improve you will have to be great in fixing problems. Not only fixing the problems but the actual underlying reason for the problem to occured in the first place. 

Root cause analysis is a powerful tool for doing that. This is what I talk about in this presentation. 

Here's all the post in the series (the links will work as I post them):

* [ca 10 minutes on Mission statements](/2015/06/ca--minutes-on-mission.html) (this post)

Please read the reason and ideas behind the [entire series in the first post](/2015/06/new-series-marcus-on-business.html).

In the presentation I give a very short introduction and just dive right into an made-up example that we did in our office. This will actually show you most of the practices you will need to know to create a root cause analysis map. 

After that there's a short discussion on what makes Root Cause Analysis work. To me that is three things: 

* A Root Cause map is big and visual
* This exercise is done together, collaborative (for best result)
* The focus should be to fix the system, not to blame the people. 

Here's a [good article](https://www.crisp.se/file-uploads/cause-effect-diagrams.pdf), should you want even more to read.
