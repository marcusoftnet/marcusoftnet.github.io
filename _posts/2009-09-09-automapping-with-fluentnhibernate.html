<p>I ran across <a href="http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2008/12/11/fluent-nhibernate.aspx" target="_blank">this post by Ayende</a> and it pretty much sums up where I want to reach with my persistence ignorance efforts:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>“After that, you are done. Just create an entity in the proper place, hit the /database/create and have a <em>lot</em> of fun.”</p> </blockquote>  <p>I of course like the fun-part of the quote the most. :) But seriously – that what I want to reach – to configure my conventions. And then simply code the model as I want it and let the framework (<a href="https://www.hibernate.org/343.html" target="_blank">NHibernate</a> in this case) figure out how to store it.</p>  <p>Well, as it seems, the <a href="http://fluentnhibernate.org/" target="_blank">Fluent NHibernate</a> framework has been updated since the Ayende post. So I’ve <a href="http://wiki.fluentnhibernate.org/Auto_mapping" target="_blank">read</a>, and <a href="http://wiki.fluentnhibernate.org/Conventions" target="_blank">read</a>, and <a href="http://wiki.fluentnhibernate.org/Available_conventions" target="_blank">read</a> and discovered <a href="http://wiki.fluentnhibernate.org/Convention_shortcut" target="_blank">some shortcuts</a>. By the way – here is an article on how to <a href="http://wiki.fluentnhibernate.org/show/ConvertingToNewStyleConventions" target="_blank">make the transition</a> from the “old” convention-style into the new.</p>  <p>I have put together an updated sample for what <a href="http://www.ayende.com/" target="_blank">Ayende</a> did in that post above. I also added a feature to be able to automatically set cascades for OneToMany- and ManyToMany-relationships. </p>  <p><a href="http://pastie.org/610731" target="_blank">Here is the most important parts</a> of the code.</p>  <p><strong>[UPDATED]     <br /></strong><a href="http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/2408484/Marcusoft.FluentAutomapper.zip" target="_blank">Here is</a> the complete sample.</p>  <p>Did I mention that I LOVE Fluent NHibernate? Well I do!</p>
