The last week was really intense, work wise, with some stuff
starting off at my primary customer and a review for another customer in
the last two days.

It all ended happily, though, with a very nice
weekend with, my now very enlarged, family. Magnus became a doctor a few
weeks back and they had an graduation party. Which made us all go to
congratulate him and also got us together on the special family-island
[Hyppeln](http://www.hyppeln.com/),
in the Gothenburg <span

picture from there, in the summer-time mind you well.

Very nice to meet all and to see the wildness of God's nature during the
winter. I could have looked at the waves for hours.

I might, saying might, have been a bit to happy to make a good
impression this weekend. But i really was, so that's
fairly right anyway.
