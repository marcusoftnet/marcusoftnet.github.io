The last week was really intense, work wise, with some stuff starting off at my primary customer and a review for another customer in the last two days.

It all ended happily, though, with a very nice weekend with, my now very enlarged, family. Magnus became a doctor a few weeks back and they had an graduation party. Which made us all go to congratulate him and also got us together on the special family-island [Hyppeln](http://www.hyppeln.com/), in the Gothenburg archipelago. The above is a picture from there, in the summer-time mind you well.

Very nice to meet all and to see the wildness of God's nature during the winter. I could have looked at the waves for hours.

I might, saying might, have been a bit too happy to make a good impression this weekend. But i really was, so that's fairly right anyway.
