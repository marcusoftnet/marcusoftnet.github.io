So as I <a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2012/12/good-bye-avega.html"
target="_blank">wrote this Friday</a> I have now left
<a href="http://www.avegagroup.se/" target="_blank">Avega Group</a>
after 8 great years. Many people asked me what I was up to now and I
held the "news" until today to handle one feeling at the time. I also
have been keeping this to myself and as quiet as possible out of respect
to Avega.

There's nothing drastic going on (yet, he said mysteriously) in what I
will be doing day-to-day; still consulting/contracting in lean/agile
coaching, with a practical focus. I have a hunch that says that I will
be doing more and more around <a href="http://www.impactmapping.org/"
target="_blank">ImpactMapping</a> soon.

But where? Where?!, they demanded over and over again.
Well here's the thing that really excites me; I'm going to a small (9
people) consultancy firm called
<a href="http://www.aptitud.se/" target="_blank">Aptitud</a>. Great
people whereof many I know since before. Having met the crew a couple of
time I can safely say that this will be something extra!


But the real cool part is to be part of building something new, a new
style or culture (link) based on values that I myself have been
preaching to other organizations.

IT contracting is sadly to this day, mainly concerned about hours and to
bill as many as possible to the client. Not only does this goes against
many of the thoughts of lean but it's also quite boring.

We, Aptitud, want something different. We want to build a hub in a
knowledge network that is bigger than our company. We are building our
company on [<span id="goog_1654367313">trust<span
id="goog_1654367314">](http://www.blogger.com/), transparency and
having fun at work.

I will of course come back to this a lot of time but let me give you two
examples where we have been challenged or made to think again, already.
I'll also tell you how that's improved our work situation already.:

-   **transparency**, you say? So what is a transparent salary spec?
    Well it's available to everyone of course. Nothing strange there. We
    post ours in Dropbox.
    BOM! With that simple measure you got rid of all questions, thoughts
    and jealousy about what other people earn and why. Check that dude's
    salary slip and talk it out, if you still think it's strange that
    Jane earns more than you
-   **trust** - we trust that you know others that might be a right fit
    for Aptitud (that has the right Aptitude, if you want :)). So if you
    do - check with any of your co-workers. If you both thinks this is
    good - let's hire her. If you still not sure, well involve one more
    then. 

These were just two simple examples where the key values have guided
Aptitud towards simple, more people friendly solutions.

We have already heard from many that we are naïve and that this won't
scale. We don't think so. We think great people accomplish great stuff -
given the freedom to do so.

Oh yeah - if you think this sounds interesting.
