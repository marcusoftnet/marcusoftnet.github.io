I found a cool tool that allows you to create, edit and show slide show
presentations online. The tool is called
<a href="http://280slides.com" target="_blank">280slides.com</a> and is
completely free.

It also allows you to upload presentations in Power Point format, to
save presentations
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing"
target="_blank">“in the cloud”</a> and also download the presentation in
several well-know formats (ppt(x) and pdf for example).

I like it!

BTW, this is my 600th post… It’s been a joy and I have no intention to
stop. But I never knew from
<a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2006/10/marcus-on-net.html"
target="_blank">the start</a>
