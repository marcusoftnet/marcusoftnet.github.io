I recently discovered a great tool for creating, editing, and presenting slideshows online: [280slides.com](http://280slides.com). It's a free platform that offers a lot of functionality.

With 280 Slides, you can:
- Create and edit presentations directly in your browser
- Upload presentations in PowerPoint format
- Save your presentations "in the cloud"
- Download presentations in several formats, including PPT(X) and PDF

I find it to be a really useful tool!

By the way, this is my 600th post. It's been a fantastic journey, and I have no plans to stop anytime soon. I never imagined when I started [here](https://www.marcusoft.net/2006/10/marcus-on-net.html) that I'd reach this milestone.
