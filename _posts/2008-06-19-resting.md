I am
celebrating the Swedish midsummer at Hyppeln in the Gothenburg
archipelago. It's perfect place to rest after the hectic period Iâ€™ve had
for a while.

The project took quite good form during the last part of the week. Feels
quite good. At Hyppeln there are almost always some good photo
opportunities. I hope to take some photos to post here after I've
returned.

Happy midsummer to you all!

Oh yeah - this is the 401 th posting of this blog. Who knew?
