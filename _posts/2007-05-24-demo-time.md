Today is the first <span>="blsp-spelling-corrected">Sprint Demo</span> for our project... We
have cover quite a distance during the project so far so i am very proud
to show this to the customer and to lift up the <span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_1"
class="blsp-spelling-corrected">achievements</span> of the project
members.

Still there is always the risk of the <span>="blsp-spelling-corrected">dreaded</span> demo-ghost - but i pray
for it to keep away today. I also have a brand new shirt on... that have
to count for something.

After just one sprint i can warmly recommend SCRUM to anyone who hasn't
tried it. It WILL get you so much more productive, with greater focus
and the ability to react to changes. All these three has been major
factors for our success so far.

So, i humbly list myself after those who witness of the greatness of
SCRUM. As a <span>="blsp-spelling-corrected">colleague</span> of mine said "If you
want quality - it's the only way to fly!"
