A couple of years ago I attended a course with
<a href="http://www.agilemanagement.net/" target="_blank">David J
Andersson</a>, father of
<a href="http://www.kanban101.com/" target="_blank">Kanban</a>, on
Kanban. I learned tons of stuff that I now use everyday but one quote
really stood out for me. We were talking about prioritization and how
it’s often hard to get business users to put values on a certain item
and thus making them hard to prioritize. David said:

> If you get a bad answer you have to ask a simpler question

I think it’s brilliant. It’s actually up to us to help them be able to
answer the question we want. So we have to help them understand the
question better. (In this case you might ask them to draw a graph
showing the possible revenue or cost or something).
Since then I’ve been carrying this thought with me; ask simple
questions. And then all of a sudden it dawned on me; this is what we’re
trying to do all the time with agile. Break down complex and hard
questions into small easier questions.
This is the third post in this small series (read part <a
href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2012/05/agile-is-good-for-business-part-i.html"
target="_blank">one</a> and <a
href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2012/05/deploying-often-is-betteragile-for-non.html"
target="_blank">two</a>), and again – if you are an agile old-timer this
is probably not new to you. Please read along but remember that this is
just me trying putting together old thoughts and practice that already
exists.

The first time I reflected on this was when I laid a jigsaw puzzle with
my son, Albert. At first the mere thought of laying all those piece (I
think it was 9 pieces) into a complete picture was daunting. And he gave
up. But then I made the puzzle a bit easier. I completed part of the
puzzle for him, and that was much much easier. And within minutes he had
laid the complete picture and was super proud.

This got my senses tingling as I felt the same sensation as when you
really get TDD working for you. You know, that feeling that the tests
are actually pulling the production code from you. And the you can
easily see the next step, based on the one you already took.

I then got that feeling again as I was doing a task for writing <a
href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2012/04/im-writing-book-on-kanban.html"
target="_blank">the book</a>; I was asked to organize the table of
contents. When first faced with the task of writing a book I wondered
how I was going to do it; just crack my knuckles and start to write at
page 1?
What we was asked to do first was to supply a table of contents. A
brilliant idea that made us break the big problem (write a 300 page
book) down to smaller pieces (write a half-a-page section). The hard
question/task was made much simpler.

Compare that to
<a href="http://www.agileproductdesign.com/blog/the_new_backlog.html"
target="_blank">user story mapping</a> that is the same thing. The hard
question; "describe the system to me", is broken down to much easier
questions (so how exactly is the login process going to work now
again?).

### Conclusion

Yeah, yeah - I know. Nothing really new and interesting here, maybe. But
I think that there's something worth thinking about here. When we break
down problems into smaller pieces they become much easier to handle and
understand. If you do this really well (as in the TDD example above) you
can even reach a point where the rest of the work is a "fill in the
blanks" exercise.

And for me, just trying to turn the tables on a "bad" answer and let it
reflect on me is worth thinking about; what can i do to get a better
answer.
