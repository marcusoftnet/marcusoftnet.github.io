Do you
remember a year back when we all was so happy to start using Visual
Studio 2005 - it's old, my friend. Old I tell you.

Microsoft is releasing [Visual Studio 2008 Beta
2](http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=7171918) which usually
means that they are about half a year from releasing a stable version of
it.

This time even I feel that things are moving quite fast in our world...
I read this [white
paper](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/info.aspx?na=47&p=1&SrcDisplayLang=en&SrcCategoryId=&SrcFamilyId=3b72271c-e996-4989-898d-72d684966ce6&u=details.aspx%3ffamilyid%3d17319EB4-299C-43B8-A360-A1C2BD6A421B%26displaylang%3den)
about it yesterday and it doesn't seem to be any big revolutions in the
release, such as the 2.0 version of the .NET framework was.
