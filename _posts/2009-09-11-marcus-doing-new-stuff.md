Two big things will (or are in the process of) happen this weekend.

The first is that I have gone over to the dark side. Yes, I know, I couldn’t resist anymore. The temptation was too great.

I have bought a MacBook Pro. And have just installed it – that process was so smooth. I want to do it again!

OK – the next thing is that I will speak at a conference for the first time ever. Actually, it’s an [Un-conference](http://www.altdotnet.se/uunconference.htm) for [alt.net Sweden](http://www.altdotnet.se/). And it’s a [lightning talk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Talk), but that only makes it harder, I think. 10 minutes – it’s not much.

The subject is “[Let Fluent NHibernate test your mappings](http://fluentnhibernate.org/).” And it relates to some of my [recent findings](https://www.marcusoft.net/2009/09/test-nhibnernate-mappings-with-fluent.html).

I know that I have spoken some bad words about Apple, so I suspect some pretty harsh comments from some areas (Fredrik? Magnus? Svante?).

Shoot! I am ready.
