Found
[this
yesterday](http://crazybob.org/2007/06/introduction-to-guice-video-redux.html)
and i liked it from two reasons:

1.  Firstly it seems like a very nice framework. Simple, light(!)weight
    and easily understandable framework for handling [dependency
    injection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection). I
    can't wait until this will become available for .NET... please say
    that it will do. Please
2.  I have a nice feeling from Google stuff - and now they are entering
    the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0"
    class="blsp-spelling-corrected">development community....
    Could be good, could be good...
   Although - they are now almost everywhere, and everybody seems to
    love them - that makes room for doing almost anything they want.
    Could be scary... so scary... :)
