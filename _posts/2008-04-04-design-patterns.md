I've been doing some reading up on design patterns, mostly actually
since i was curious on the book - [Head First Design
Patterns](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/hfdesignpat/).

It is great - i can honestly say that it is the best IT-related book
I've ever read. It is the first time (embarrassing enough) I understand
some of these patterns. It covers a lot of different aspects and do just
enough of deep exploration. And (not least) it is FUN - i actually laugh
when i read it. When did you do that reading for example [this
book](http://safari.oreilly.com/0596526997) (which also is good, but not
fun...).

However - a colleague tipped me on a great resource for pattern
explanations on line:

Thanks Calle for the tip, and for borrowing the book
