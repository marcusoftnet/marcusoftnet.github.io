Currently working with the Salvation Army in Indonesia, I oversee operations across six hospitals in this vast country. Given our limited travel budget, I've endeavored to leave behind valuable teachings. To achieve this, I've developed a series of presentations on critical topics. The first three cover [mission](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkLhlJyfpsw), [vision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc0zvNymNcM), and [strategic plans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ibno8_CN9U), each lasting 10-15 minutes.

As I don't speak Bahasa Indonesia fluently, the primary language here, I initially present in English. However, to make the content accessible, I utilize YouTube's excellent subtitle tool to translate the presentations into Indonesian. This process has proven effective and surprisingly straightforward.

In this post, I'll walk you through the steps I took so you can expand the reach of your presentations/videos too.

# The Creation

The initial section outlines how I created the video for uploading to YouTube. If you're solely interested in [subtitles](#subtitles), feel free to skip ahead.

## Creating the Presentation

Referencing my previous post on [presentation preparation](http://www.marcusoft.net/2014/11/how-i-prepare-presentation.html), I follow a structured approach that aids in preparing, recording, and translating the content.

## Recording the Presentation

When recording, I adhere closely to the presenter notes. While I may digress during live presentations, I maintain a more structured approach for recordings. Rehearsing before recording helps ensure the content aligns with the notes.

## Producing the Presentation

I utilize Camtasia for recording and editing the video. The slide presentation is recorded separately and later combined using Camtasia's editing features.

# [Subtitles](#subtitles)

While the subtitle instructions may seem detailed, the process becomes remarkably swift with practice. For my second video onward, it typically took around 10 minutes, including a 5-minute wait time on YouTube.

## Add Subtitles

Upon uploading your video to [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com), access the [Creator Studio](https://www.youtube.com/dashboard?o=U) by clicking your avatar logo. Navigate to the CC and Subtitles option.

## Gotchas

There are two important considerations regarding automatic subtitles and publication.

### Automatic Subtitles

YouTube automatically generates subtitles based on voice recognition. Unless your English is perfect, it's advisable to unpublish this version.

### Publish the Subtitles

Ensure the subtitles you created are published to make them accessible to viewers.

## Translate the Subtitles

You have two options for translating subtitles: the user way and the publisher way.

### User Way

Users can utilize YouTube's built-in translation feature to translate subtitles into their preferred language.

### Publisher Way

Publishers can manually translate subtitles by uploading a translated subtitle file.

# Summary

Despite the detailed explanation, the entire process typically takes around 10 minutes per video. I trust you'll find this guide useful, as I anticipate referring back to it myself.
