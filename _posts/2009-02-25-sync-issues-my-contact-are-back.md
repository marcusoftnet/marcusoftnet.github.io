With a little help from <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/features/sync-center.aspx"
target="_blank">Windows Sync Center</a> and my own stupidity all my
contacts (200+) disappeared without any possibility to undo. I actually
answered Yes to the question “Are you sure” but I didn’t get the concept
partnership…

But what are friends for… My good friend Christer did some forensic work
at my customer computer and managed to bring all the contacts back to
life…

Thank you Christer! I was at a loss without my contacts. Everyone was a
new acquaintance.
