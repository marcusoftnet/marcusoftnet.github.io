We are planning to setup a web camera to view the Scrum Board. This
has to do with the team being highly distributed (200 km
apart) and us still wanting to maintain some sort of contact.

However - i am lacking a lot in understanding and interest in hardware
stuff as for example web cameras. So it took me quite some time to find
a good server. But now i have: [YawCam](http://www.snapfiles.com/get/yawcam.html)

It has all i wanted; you can stream video, it is easy to administrate
and you can do minor modification to the output/quality and such stuff.
And yeah - it's free also ;)

Get one now! Thank you [Magnus Lundvall](http://www.snapfiles.com/publishers/magnus-lundvall/index.html "Visit the website of the publisher")
who created it. Great app!
