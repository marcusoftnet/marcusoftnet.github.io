We are planning to setup a web camera to view the Scrum Board. This
has to do with the team <span>="blsp-spelling-corrected">being</span> highly distributed (200 km
apart) and us still wanting to maintain some sort of contact.

However - i am lacking a lot in understanding and interest in hardware
stuff as for example web cameras. So it took me quite some time to find
a good server. But now i have: [<span>="blsp-spelling-error">YawCam</span>](http://www.snapfiles.com/get/yawcam.html)

It has all i wanted; you can stream video, it is easy to administrate
and you can do minor modification to the output/quality and such stuff.
And yeah - it's free also ;)

Get one now! Thank you [<span>="blsp-spelling-error">Magnus</span> <span>="blsp-spelling-error">Lundvall</span>](http://www.snapfiles.com/publishers/magnus-lundvall/index.html "Visit the website of the publisher")
who created it. Great app!
