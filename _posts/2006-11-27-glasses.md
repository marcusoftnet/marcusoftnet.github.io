Went to the optician last Friday. Some headache and problem with my eyes made me go. And ... yes I need glasses when I work at the computer and reads.

Feels like an old man! My arms needs to be longer to be able to see good. Will now go through gruesome process of choosing my "looks". I think I'll go for either the Tintin Japanese or maybe "german terrorist".
