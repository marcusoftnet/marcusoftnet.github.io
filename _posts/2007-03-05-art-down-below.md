Found this site <http://www.istadensspar.se/>.

Apparently this is a guy that used to drive a subway train in Stockholm
underground who got tired of getting the same question all of the time;
"what does it look like in the tunnels?". So he brought his camera and
took some pretty amazing pictures.

The pictures on the site is just a small selection of the pictures in
the book but very very nice. The book will probably be bought and placed
on a future coffetable...
