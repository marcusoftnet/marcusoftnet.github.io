Found this site <http://www.istadensspar.se/>.

Apparently this is a guy that used to drive a subway train in Stockholm underground who got tired of getting the same question all of the time; "what does it look like in the tunnels?". So he brought his camera and took some pretty amazing pictures.

The pictures on the site is just a small selection of the pictures in the book but very very nice. The book will probably be bought and placed on a future coffee table...
