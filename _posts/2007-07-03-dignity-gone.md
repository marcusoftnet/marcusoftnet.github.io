Here is a story about when my dignity was shredded. True i am afraid.

This weekend the Salvation Army Congress was held here in Sweden. We
played with a small band on the last meeting, which of course was way to
long for my tired eyes. So afterwards i rushed to get out instruments
and packing.

Coming up from the basement i found a small boy (4 years maybe) pointing
to a toilet saying: "He's bleeding". And right he was - in the toilet
was another boy bleeding from his nose. A lot. Inside the toilet was
also an old Salvation Army missionary women. And she was not afraid of
digging in. I found her (ca 90 years mind you) wiping the floor and
pinching the nose of the boy at the same time.

Of course I told her that she didn't have to do that. I took over the
situation, putting down the gear and with my euphonium on the back.
The boy with the nosebleed was cleaned up - he was
"mother-fainting"-messy, i can tell you. All of a sudden the boy outside
cries: "I need the bathroom. Now!"
Me: "Give us 30 seconds"
Boy: "I can't hold it"
Me: "Uh-uh"

So we switched places. The small boy into the bathroom and me and mr
Nosy outside. I put the bleeder in the stairs to rest.

The small boy cries again: "I am done...". So i replied: "...well ...
come out then...".

Well he didn't so i open the door. He was still on the toilet looking at
me, almost shameful:
"I have made \#2!" - How did he want me to react to that! Corking up the
champange?
Marcus: "Well.... done? Please come out"
"I can't clean myself"

Here i understood where this was going, should probably have been sooner
but anyway... I found myself saying: "I'll help you"
Said and done. He "assumed" the position and for the first time ever i
was wiping the butt of a four-year old. No, i said, no dignity left.

As this ... scene was taking place the other boy opened the door and
asked if he could have his coke back. I was surprised that he didn't
find the quite disturbing scene offensive at all.

When all this was done - the boys left. I wiped up some blood on the
walls and door of the toilet. Took the rest of the gear and left also.
Not in the mood for any food in a while but happy that they were both
OK.
