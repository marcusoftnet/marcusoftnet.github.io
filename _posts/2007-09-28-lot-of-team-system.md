This <span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">entire week
has been concerned with Team Foundation Server (<span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-error"><span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-error">TFS) and
Visual Studio Team System (VSTS).

There are really a lot of interesting features in this product. Some are
excellent (the source control system and the ability to share data in
the development project) and some not excellent yet (i miss a lot of
easy configuration stuff for msbuild for example). In short
i like it. A lot.

But the more i learn about TFS the more i want to use
<span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_4" class="blsp-spelling-error">TFS to
the full extend of the product. I have a hunch that it will rock more
and more as you start to use more and more features.

There are also a lot of interesting and useful stuff on
the NET about it. Here are some introduction videos for example:

ps.
Changed my mind - that link is GREAT. The first two videos i saw could
have helped us so much at the outset of our project...
