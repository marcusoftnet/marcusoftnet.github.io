4BarsRest are a bit slower than me ;-) but here is a an article about the [Swedish BrassBand Championships.](http://www.4barsrest.com/news/detail.asp?id=4441)

But Gothenburg has not won the US Championships, to my knowledge, but became world champions 1988, and that event was held in Australia.

Again - that was the best competition in Sweden ever! I hope that it will be more of the same level.
