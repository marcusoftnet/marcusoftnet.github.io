In 2013 I got invited to write blog posts for [CodeBetter.com](CodeBetter.com). I was quite surprised and honoured, since that's a place where I've read many great posts over the year. 

I hopped to the challenge though (never regretted doing that) and ended up writing 6 posts, before I lost tempo. 

I'm actually proud of all those posts and wanted to preserve them here on my site also. I noticed that CodeBetter.com has slowed down and went away completely the other week without anyone noticing. So I thought it would be better to save them somewhere else. 

Here's they are:

<!-- excerpt-end -->

My first post was on [mob programming](/2013/08/repost-mob-programming-full-team-full-throttle.html) and was the first post on the topic written by someone else than Woody Zuill. It's even mentioned on the [wikipedia page for mob programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_programming) and those facts makes me immensely proud

I wrote a few post on a the work I was doing at my current client there, the first one was about how we [visualised our backlog and board](http://www.marcusoft.net/2013/08/repost-some-tools-for-improved-focus-improve-teamwork-and-faster-delivery.html)

And then a post on a tool that I have used many times under my consultancy career; [weighted index table](/2013/09/repost-weighted-index-a-simple-powerful-prioritization-tool.html)

At the time when I wrote these things I learned about A/B testing for the first time and wrote a [post about being data-driven](/2014/01/repost-do-we-dare-to-be-data-driven.html) and what kind of implications it has on doing business. 

I mused over a comment that someone said about us [doing lean backwards](/2017/04/repost-the-time-when-we-did-lean-backwards.html) and what that would mean.

My last post on CodeBetter.com (so far) was the first thing I wrote on [Koa](http://koajs.com/). A framework that completely took me by surprise. This post marks the first venture for me into Javascript land.  I was so happy to [get rid of the pesky callbacks that haunted me.](/2014/05/repost-beyond-callbacks-or-how-koa-helps-me-code-better.html) 

## Conclusion

CodeBetter.com is not dead, as far as I know. But I wanted to preserve my posts here. 

Thanks to Jekyll time machine capabilities you can now [read those posts here,](http://www.marcusoft.net/tags/#CodeBetter) sorted in chronological order of writing.
