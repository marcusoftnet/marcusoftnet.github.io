Saw a movie yesterday that i must recommend; Lucky Number Slevin
(<http://www.slevin-movie.com/>).

It's in the same spirit as The usual suspects and i really enjoyed it.
Great performances by some great actors also. Lucy Lui was awsome and
the guy (Josh Hartnett) playing the lead character did a great job
too.

So if You havn't seen it ... Do it now! It is well worth the time and
money.
