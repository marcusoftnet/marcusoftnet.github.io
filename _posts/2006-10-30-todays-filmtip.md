Saw a movie yesterday that I must recommend; Lucky Number Slevin (<http://www.slevin-movie.com/>).

It's in the same spirit as The usual suspects and I really enjoyed it. Great performances by some great actors also. Lucy Lui was awesome and the guy (Josh Hartnett) playing the lead character did a great job too.

So if You haven't seen it ... Do it now! It is well worth the time and money.
