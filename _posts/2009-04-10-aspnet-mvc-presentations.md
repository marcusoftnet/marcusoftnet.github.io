I found these two great presentations surrounding ASP.NET MVC:

- [File|New -> Company: Creating NerdDinner.com with Microsoft ASP.NET Model View Controller (MVC)](http://videos.visitmix.com/MIX09/T49F) – Really funny too...
- [Microsoft ASP.NET Model View Controller (MVC): Ninja on Fire Black Belt Tips](http://videos.visitmix.com/MIX09/T44F) – A bit slow presentation, but some real nuggets are to be found.

I haven't watched them all the way through yet, but they promise a great deal.
