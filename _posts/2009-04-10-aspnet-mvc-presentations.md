Found these two great presentations surronding ASP.NET MVC.

-   <a href="http://videos.visitmix.com/MIX09/T49F" target="_blank">File|New
    -&gt; Company: Creating NerdDinner.com with Microsoft ASP.NET Model View
    Controller (MVC)</a> - really funny too...
-   <a href="http://videos.visitmix.com/MIX09/T44F"
    target="_blank">Microsoft ASP.NET Model View Controller (MVC): Ninja on
    Fire Black Belt Tips</a> - a bit slow presentation but some real
    nuggest are to be found

I haven't seen them straight through yet - but they promise a great
deal.
