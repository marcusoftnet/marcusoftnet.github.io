At my current client we are trying to make a change to focus more on [flow than on resource utilization](http://www.marcusoft.net/2018/05/thinking-in-flow-some-recent-thoughts.html). This is harder than it sounds because much of the current ways of working, structures, roles and rewards are built to support another mindset. 

One of the things that lately have popped up for me are the words we are using to describe the roles we have in  different parts of the organisation. This heavily prevailing in the IT-industry and maybe agile actually has helped to cement a few of these (an [excellent keynote by Michael Feathers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odJ8esf2h6E) put me onto that idea). 

This also ties into great quote from [David L. Marquet and his excellent Turn the Ship around book](https://www.amazon.com/Turn-Ship-Around-Turning-Followers-ebook/dp/B00AFPVP0Y)

> There's no they on Santa Fee!

Let me try to explain.

## On the sub
When David Marquet was the captain on USS Santa Fee (a submarine, read the book it's awesome) one of the things that he saw as a limiting factor was that there was a lot of complaints about what others should have done:
* we are waiting for delivery of X
* X are not done yet
* This is out of our hands, loading crew should do that

At some point in time he got enough and just blurted out:

> There's no They on Santa Fee! You cannot use that word any more

It also happen to ryhme and stuck immediately. And the difference in taking responsibility of the whole was changed too. He relates a story shortly after where a seaman said: 'Captain, we will be late in leaving the dock today.'. When David Marquet asked why the seaman caught himself mid-sentence:

> They ... ... ... we have not delivered the torpedoes on time

He left and started to fix the problem by reaching out to the torpedo-delivery team and offer his teams help. 

## In the office
There's many voices in the agile community now being raised to do away with the notion of "Projects". As in a software development effort that we start at some point in time and then end - handing over whatever we produced to a governing organsiation.

* At my current client we are bouncing ideas about not having "Developing" and "Maintenance" as two separate roles. All we do would be "Developing". Or "Maintenance". Or work plain and simple. 
* Still to this day I, also, hear people talking about work being handed over to "Testing". As if the work is now someone elses problem and that quality can be fixed, magically by testing really good. Quality is (should be) built in to the product from the start. 

My own personal pet hate is the divided between "The Business" and "IT". Here's my understanding of the setup:

There are someone that apparently is expected to know everything that other bunch of people should do and then feed them that in bit-sized chunks. We have decided to call these people "The business". They are doing business - that's why we call them that. How they find time to come up with things for us to do is very hard to understand, and often they don't have that time. We might have a "Business proxy" that translate what they need for the people that are doing it. It is something that the business need. Not the customer, but the business to business away. 

Then there's another sorry bunch of people whose brains are set in making mode. They are "IT". They IT business stuff. ITing away. Their customer is called "The business". Most of the time the things we get handed is well defined, becuase if it's not we will have to "go back to the business" and ask for clarifications. This is troublesome for both IT and the business. 

And interesting enough agile has pushed this divided from the get-go. One of the principles says [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/) 'Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.' And both Scrum and XP have roles that specifically spells out the difference between the team and the product owner and customer proxy. 
In all honesty one of the values are spelling out the need for Customer collaboration. Even more in all honesty the agile manifesto was written in 2001, so it would be a tall order for it to keep up for that long time. 

Ok ... I've calmed down now. Rant is over. Let's be a bit more solution focus.

## What if we had "No they on Santa Fe" in our office
As you noticed above I can sometimes get worked up over these terms and even more how they are hindering us from progressing to a better future. 

Let's play a game! It's called "You cannot use the term _____" and see what happens. I have nothing particular against these words (ah ... well ....) but just for fun and profit; what would happen. 

Below is me playing this game on myself. What did you come up with?

| You cannot use ____   | This sentence would then   | become this:   |
|---|---|---|
| Maintenance  | There! The development project is over now - it's now handed over to _maintenance_ | There! We have done features and improvement for awhile, and will continue to do some more features and improvements   |
| Testing  | I hope they don't find a lot of bugs in _testing_. The time line is tight! | I hope we find a lot of bugs early, before working in _working with code_. The time line is tight   |
| The Business  | _The Business_ has called a meeting - there are new directions for how the product will develop. I wonder what it can be? | We have a workshop later to decide on the future for the product. Exciting! I have a few ideas since the last couple of tests I wrote. |
| Ops (or DevOps)  | Oh Lordy... I need this out now - but _the ops guys_ (or _the devops ladies_) are busy. Doh! | Oh Lordy ... I need this out now. Better get going writing a deployment script myself, I guess. We are all _Devops_ now.  |
| Project  | Sorry I cannot take on that urgent matter. I'm fully booked for project A  |   |
