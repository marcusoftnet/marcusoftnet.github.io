Things are settling down over here again... After a week at home with Albert (the most probable name of our son) we are now actually thinking that we might make it. ;)

There are so many clich√©s about becoming a parent but it is really something that you can't imagine. You are tossed between loving the child - sometimes too much even - to becoming very frustrated because you can't understand him.

I am really surprised that this is not talked about more. From a small empirical investigation it seems that most children have this problem.

Well this "problem" is small in comparison to the joy of having the child. We love him! It's quite amazing how you can feel so much about a child that you just met 10 days ago... But he is really the apple of our eye.
