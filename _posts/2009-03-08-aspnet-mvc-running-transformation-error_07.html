<p>The <a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2009/03/aspnet-mvc-running-transformation-error.html" target="_blank">issue that I had</a> with creating views for nested classes is solved with a new release of the <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/" target="_blank">ASP.NET MVC</a> RC. </p>  <p>Thanks to some very fast response from <a href="http://haacked.com/" target="_blank">Phil Haack</a> I’ve got to know about a new release of the framework. Here is <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;FamilyID=ee4b2e97-8a72-449a-82d2-2f720d421031" target="_blank">the link to the RC II of the ASP.NET MVC</a>.</p>  <p>Worked fine and as I said solved my problem. </p>
