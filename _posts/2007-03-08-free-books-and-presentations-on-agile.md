Found the site [InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com/) (do NOT mix this with
[AvenueQ](http://www.avenueq.com/)) that contains some very good
articles, presentations and even books about agile development and
related stuff. Have up to now just seen and read some parts but it all
looks very promising.

Here are my shortlist so far:

-   Book on [Domain Driven
    Design](http://www.infoq.com/minibooks/domain-driven-design-quickly)
-   [Great OOP
    presentation](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/principles-agile-oo-design)
-   [Visual Studio tips and
    tricks](http://www.infoq.com/minibooks/vsnettt)

This will be often visited by me in the future. I promise...
