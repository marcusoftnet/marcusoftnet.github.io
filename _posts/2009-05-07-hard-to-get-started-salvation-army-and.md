I have some real trouble getting back into my normal flow after [Ethiopia](http://www.marcusoft.net/2009/05/pictures-from-ethopia.html).

This week, I will play and do the presentations at a concert with [Solna Brass](http://www.solnabrass.se/). And there has been a lot of stuff with the [Salvation Army](http://www.fralsningsarmen.se/vasakaren) and [the band](http://www.vasaband.com/).

Iâ€™ll try to get to it next week.

By the way, the [Vasa Band](http://www.vasaband.se) got a good review of the CD Priority in [Brass Band World](http://www.brassbandworld.com/). Here is a picture of it:

The review was next to the review of [A Breathless Alleluia](http://www.naxos.com/catalogue/item.asp?item_code=8.572166) by the [Black Dyke Band](http://www.blackdykeband.co.uk/)... Something to be compared to!
