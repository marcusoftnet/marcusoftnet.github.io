Finally - after 9 months our baby has arrived. It is the most wonderful little boy you can imagine and we are so grateful for having him into our life.

Here are some pictures of him.

Right now we are quite tired also, so i'll get back with details later on. A very quick thank you to all the people that have prayed for, warm thought.
