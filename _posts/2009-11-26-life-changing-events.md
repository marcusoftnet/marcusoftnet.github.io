Often, you can’t see them until afterwards... the events that really changed the course of your life. But in retrospect, you can almost always point to a single moment when your life took a certain path.

Yesterday was one of those events. I know exactly when it happened: 15:12, 2009-11-25.

We are going to have a second child. So we went to the ultrasound examination to see that everything was in order. And it was.

> The nurse: Here is the divider wall (sorry for the non-technical term in English).
> Me (thinking): I never heard about any divider wall when Albert was in there.
> Nurse: And here is the first fetus.
> Me: Ok... the first one. Nice... What? First one?

After that, the nurse had to leave us. Two takes longer than one. So I told Elin, "That just now, that was a life-changing event."

So, we’re going to have TWINS! In April!

It’s still very new and a bit hard to get used to, but it will hopefully sink in soon. I still have some trouble seeing myself as a dad—now I’m gonna be a big-family-guy/dad.

Right now we’re tossed between extreme happiness and strong bewilderment. Mostly happy.
