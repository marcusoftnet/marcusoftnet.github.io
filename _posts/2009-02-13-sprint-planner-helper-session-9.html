<p>This hour almost entirely was reading. I didn’t not feel comfortable yet with terms Repository and Service, or how they relate to each other. </p>  <p>Also I feel that I have looked to much at the architecture of <a href="http://www.asp.net/learn/mvc-videos/#MVCStorefrontStarterKit">ASP.NET MVC Storefront Starter Kit</a>. I have incorporated stuff that I didn’t thought to much about – stupid, but I did it anyway. </p>  <p>But after a while I found this <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dd419654.aspx">introduction to DDD</a> and it explained some things for me. Here is how I understand the two fore-mentioned concepts:</p>  <ul>   <li>A <strong>Repository</strong> are classes and methods that is used to load stuff from a data store. They are often written in a way that is easily mocked or replaced during testing. </li>    <li>A <strong>Service </strong>is used to hold a process or a flow through a business logic that does not fit well on a class in the domain model. They are stateless and take the entity that they operate on as parameter or loads the entities into memory via a repository.</li> </ul>  <p>Right now – in my solution there is a strange layering going on… The Controller is calling the Service that in turn calls the Repository. Although that could happen there really is no need for it since I am only getting stuff yet. If I later on need some functionality that doesn’t fit well into my domain model I will introduce a service for that. </p>  <p>Finally – so what I did was simply to remove the services and then TDD:ed (hey, that looks funky) a way to inject a repository into the Controller. It caused me to move things around a bit in the solution. But for the better. I learned that test-projects should only contain tests. TestData Repositories for examples are better placed in the Repositories-assembly.</p>  <p>I am really going back and forth – but at least I know what I am doing. And that’s the way you learn. Especially since I am on my own.    </p>
