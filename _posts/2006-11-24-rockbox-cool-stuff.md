Found a
really cool MP3-thingy...

[RockBox](http://www.rockbox.org/) is a freeware "operating system" for
a lot of different hard wares. I love my [Iriver
H320](http://www.iriver.com/html/product/prpa_product.asp?pidx=42) and
it just became even cooler with the new RockBox operating system.

RockBox contains a lot of nice features and utilities and i am looking
forward to learning them all. My favorites so far is the metronome (in
all its simplicity) and that you can download and play
[Doom](http://www.rockbox.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/PluginDoom) on it!
