In the
brass band one of the most neglected instrument is the tenor horn. It's
however very important for the sound of the band to have good horn
players. But since the horn players seldom get the opportunity to
"shine" not many player plays it and there is the dilemma.

So it's rare and really fun to here really good horn players and the
best one around right now must be Owen Farr. He is featured this week on
[Listen To The
Band](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/aod/networks/radio2/aod.shtml?radio2/listenband)
in finale of Mendelssohn's violin concerto.

It's simply breathtaking! I can't believe some of the sounds and
technique he produces. I am for the first time in my life thinking of
buying a CD with a tenor horn player.

I am doing it! Now!
