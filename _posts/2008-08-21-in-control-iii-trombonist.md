This
is not for the faint hearted, but well worth seeing.

Its a clip from a recording session of the film music to the movie
Hellboy. And the sounds these dudes produces are just ... well scary.

For any non-brass players I can tell you that to produce one of those
"bursts" is hard. Really hard. To do 15 or so in a row is just
amazing.

And now for something completely different. The best trombone player
(not counting the bass trombone dudes above) in my opinion is Håkan
Björkman. Here is a clip of him doing a cadenza of the Leopold Mozart's
Alto-trombone concerto. Very different - but still amazing.

Yeah - this is also something that shouldn't be possible to accomplish.
I have heared it live at the Stockholm Opera once.
