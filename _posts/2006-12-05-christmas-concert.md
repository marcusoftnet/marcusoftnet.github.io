I will be
presenter at a concert in Gothenburg this weekend. It's the [Gothenburg
BrassBand](http://www.goteborgbrassband.org.se/) Lucia-concert that is
taking place this weekend each year.

I am really looking forward to this - part to meet the band again (so
many friends) and part just because it's fun. A bit scary though since i
rather play and speak than just speak. The expectations seems to be
raised when you only speak. If You stand up from the band and then say
something people always thinks it nice but if you just come in as a
presenter they seem to expect you to be good. But - I'll run my old race
and that's it.

It will be great either way. Gothenburg - here I come.
