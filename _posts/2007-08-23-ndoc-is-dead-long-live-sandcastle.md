As i [written
before](http://marcushammarberg.blogspot.com/2007/07/sandcastle-or-marcus-betting-on-wrong.html)
Microsoft is plugging a documentation product called Sandcastle as a
replacement for <span>="blsp-spelling-error">NDoc</span>. I was wondering were <span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-error">NDoc</span> had gone
but today i found [this
article](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/SandcastleMicrosoftCTPOfAHelpCHMFileGeneratorOnTheTailsOfTheDeathOfNDoc.aspx)
which explains a lot. The header of the article is quite scary "...
death of <span>="blsp-spelling-error">NDoc</span>".

I've tried Sandcastle today and i am not impressed:


-   The product is still in <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_3"
    class="blsp-spelling-error">CTP</span> (Community Technology
    Preview) - and it shows. It is not done yet!
-   No good support exists (out-of-the-box) for <span
    id="SPELLING_ERROR_4" class="blsp-spelling-error">MSBuild</span>
    integration. There are some third-party product
-   It is <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_5"
    class="blsp-spelling-error">sloo</span>-ow. At least twice the time
    compared to <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_6"
    class="blsp-spelling-error">NDoc</span>.

I can only hope that these things will get better as the final <span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_7" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">release</span>
arrives. Or will it be part of Visual Studio 2008 - that is my guess.
