As I [written before](https://www.marcusoft.net/2007/07/sandcastle-or-marcus-betting-on-wrong.html) Microsoft is plugging a documentation product called Sandcastle as a replacement for NDoc. I was wondering were NDoc had gone but today I found [this article](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/SandcastleMicrosoftCTPOfAHelpCHMFileGeneratorOnTheTailsOfTheDeathOfNDoc.aspx) which explains a lot. The header of the article is quite scary "...death of NDoc".

I've tried Sandcastle today and I am not impressed:

- The product is still in CTP (Community Technology Preview) - and it shows. It is not done yet!
- No good support exists (out-of-the-box) for MSBuild integration. There are some third-party product
- It is *SLOW*. At least twice the time compared to NDoc.

I can only hope that these things will get better as the final release arrives. Or will it be part of Visual Studio 2008 - that is my guess.
