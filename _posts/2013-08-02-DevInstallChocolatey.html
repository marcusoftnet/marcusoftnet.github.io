<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Up to now I have sadly not have time to look into <a href="http://chocolatey.org/" target="_blank">Chocolatey</a>. I know what it is but I haven't played with it. As the time grew closer to set up a new development machine I thought I'd give it a run Chocolatey a run for it's money.<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Could my entire development environment be installed using a script? That is - from a bare-bones Windows installation could I run a script and get <i>every</i>thing I needed in place.</blockquote>This was a real challenge since I don't know (nor want to learn) any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_PowerShell" target="_blank">powershell</a>&nbsp;and consider myself to be a newbie Chocolatey user.<br /><br />This post describes my journey.<br /><br /><a name='more'></a><h3 style="text-align: left;">Getting a virtual windows installation in place</h3><div>I use OS X and <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank">VirtualBox</a>&nbsp;to run virtual instances of windows. Creating a virtual image is simple enough in VirtualBox and then you can attach an .iso-file with the Windows installation.</div><div><br /></div><div>The Windows 8.1 installation was pretty fast and within 30-40 minutes I had a bare-bones Windows installation in place.&nbsp;</div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Getting my stuff in place - local version</h3><div>One of the really cool things about&nbsp;Chocolatey is that you can install it directly from the prompt (that's cmd-prompt, no powershell stuff) with a command you just copy from <a href="http://chocolatey.org/" target="_blank">their homepage</a>:</div><script src="https://gist.github.com/marcusoftnet/6131900.js"></script> When Chocolatey is installed you can start using it's <a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CommandsReference" target="_blank">commands</a>&nbsp;of which the most interesting is the "<span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;"><a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CommandsInstall" target="_blank">cinst</a></span>" command. This is the command that installs a <a href="http://chocolatey.org/packages" target="_blank">Chocolatey package</a>&nbsp;for you. I ended up using "<span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;"><a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CommandsInstallMissing" target="_blank">cinstm</a></span>"that only does the install if the package isn't installed before.<br /><br />This means that it's now only a matter of doing a long list of powershell (cinst is a powershell command) commands. Like this one for example that installs <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/" target="_blank">7Zip</a>:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/marcusoftnet/6131989.js"></script>There are four problems with this, at least for me:<br /><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>I don't like powershell</li><li>I don't want to sit around issuing commands every other minute or hour (for big installs)</li><li>It's not repeatable</li><li>I don't know or remember the packages I want to have. Chocolatey has 1200 packages at the time of writing.</li></ul>Let's leave that last one and address the other issues first. I would like a file with these commands in and then just execute those commands. This can be done (thanks <a href="https://github.com/carllindelof" target="_blank">Calle</a> for the tip) with this command:<br /><div><script src="https://gist.github.com/marcusoftnet/6132033.js"></script></div><div>And then my devApps.ps1 file just contains installation commands I want. Like this for example:<br /><br />I could then merge the "get&nbsp;Chocolatey"&nbsp;-command with the "install dev apps"-command and have a single install.bat that I run to get this to run:<br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/marcusoftnet/6132068.js"></script> <br /><h3 style="text-align: left;">Getting my stuff in place - cloud version</h3></div><div>If you start looking around in the Chocolatey package directory you'll soon get too-much-apathy. There's really no way to know what is in there without searching for it, which implies that you know what to search for. And what is good.</div><div><br /></div><div>Over a number of installations and years we have all stacked up our own favorite tools and utilities that we like (and in some cases have a unhealthy relationship with). &nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Now if there could only be a way to save my list of things that I like and usually install. This way I could share it with others and get tips, suggestions and maybe even inspire them.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>But hey - there is such a way! I can store my <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">devApps.ps1</span>-file in the cloud, at <a href="https://github.com/marcusoftnet/ScriptsAndStuff/blob/master/DevMachineInstall/devApps.ps1" target="_blank">GitHub.com </a>for example. &nbsp;There people could actually make pull requests and forks of my file to improve it.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>So now I can only copy that file onto every new machine ... no - wait. There's a better way. Chocolatey used a cool little function called <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString()</span> in their install command. I can use that too and download my devApps.ps1 file from Github.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Like this:</div><script src="https://gist.github.com/marcusoftnet/6133821.js"></script> <br /><div>A small gotcha for me was that you have to reference the RAW-version of the file. Of course, once you think about it since you don't want to download the GitHub HTML-page. Of course - but I missed that the first time around.&nbsp;</div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Summary</h3><div>This is so cool - I now have a installation script for all my development application that takes my machine from bare-bones Windows too fully installed development mode. Its repeatable (if I need to do this), it's shareable (so I can get tips and suggestions and share with others), its automated (I don't have to do next, next, next for hours) and I only one powershell command. Not too bad.<br /><br />My installation scripts can be found, forked and improved here:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/marcusoftnet/ScriptsAndStuff">https://github.com/marcusoftnet/ScriptsAndStuff</a><br /><h3 style="text-align: left;">Update&nbsp;</h3></div><div>Right smack in the middle of my installation my virtual machine rebooted. I don't really know why but that gave script-based installations time to really shine.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>How did I recover from such a horrible thing as a machine reboot?&nbsp;</div><div>Simple - just ran the exact same script again. Since it's using <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">cinstm </span><span style="font-family: inherit;">the script went through what was installed already and then continued where it ended... I had to rerun the command but that was all. Cool. Really cool!</span><br /><h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Update 2</span></h3></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">It worked... Kind of (see below)! It took me about 4 hours of letting the script run. Resharper and WebEssentials2012 failed but that was because of me. The script installed those add-ins to Visual Studio before Visual Studio itself. So I modified the <a href="https://github.com/marcusoftnet/ScriptsAndStuff" target="_blank">script</a> to run the Visual Studio installs first.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Also I failed. I forgot that for Visual Studio 2013 Preview you also need to install</span>&nbsp;"ASP.NET and Web Tools 2013 Refresh". But that's for a preview product so I felt that it didn't count. Now did it?&nbsp;</div></div>
