As I [told you a while
ago](http://www.marcusoft.net/2008/11/blogging-in-two-places-avega-group-blog.html)
I am since a while back blogging for [Avega
Group](http://www.avegagroup.se/) as well as here at
[www.marcusoft.net](http://www.marcusoft.net). I feel really honored
that Avega wanted to have my random ramblings at their site.

The [new site for Avega](http://www.avegagroup.se/) is now live and you
can find the [blog here](http://blog.avegagroup.se/). My own personal
Avega blog can be found at
<http://blog.avegagroup.se/MarcusHammarberg/>.

There are some really cool photos also. Avega uses a great photographer
that always delivers such great things.

Alright - the <http://blog.avegagroup.se/MarcusHammarberg/> will of
course mostly contain technical stuff. But I'll post everything here
first...
