Wow - here is a whole concert with the two great bands, in top form
as it sounds. And with the extra treat of hearing Philip Smith playing
Victorious (is it a bit sloppy for the worlds greatest trumpeter...?).
There are also some other great items from other occations

Click on "Band profile" for the complete concert...
