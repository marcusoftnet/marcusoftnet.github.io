Last week, during the [Kanban course](https://www.marcusoft.net/2009/09/kanban-great-agile-tool.html), we discussed [Root Cause Analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_cause_analysis) multiple times. It's a powerful technique for identifying the "root of all evil," or at least the underlying issues causing problems.

While the fundamental concepts of Root Cause Analysis are straightforward, having some guidance and best practices can be incredibly helpful. [Henrik Kniberg](http://www.crisp.se/henrik.kniberg/) has once again come to the rescue with a [great article on cause-effect diagrams](http://www.crisp.se/henrik.kniberg/cause-effect-diagrams.pdf), complete with a humorous touch.

Thanks, Henrik, for the valuable insights!
