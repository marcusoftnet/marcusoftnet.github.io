I've just ended a long period with lots of stuff on the agenda. Since April 10th i've had at least on "extra" thing to think about each day. It's been some presentations, funerals, talks at work or just practices with band.<br /><br />But yesterday i did the last of this long row of items. Feels really good and tonight will be laid back to say the least... Some practice and then a movie i think
