Today is the day! I will get my glasses. A bit scared but after
blistering headache yesterday i hope that they will solve at least a
part of that.

Also I have to stop to mock all my friends around me with glasses.
Calling them old people may not be so good thinking since i am one
also... Well, a new life is approaching
