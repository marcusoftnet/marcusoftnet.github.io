Can't start this week in any other way than to praise Anja Pärsson... The Swedish flying skiier, looking like a lightning in the slopes. With thighs that is bigger than both my put together.

She is so good - and this after a really bad season where she haven't won anything at all and we (swedes) all counted her out about the 1 nov. But she proved us wrong and now she's defilating through the world cup. In Åre, Sweden.

I am most impressed and hope that we all get inspired by her personality, fighting spirit and joy in the slopes.
