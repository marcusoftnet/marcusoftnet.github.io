Can't start this week in any other way than to praise Anja Pärsson...
The Swedish flying skiier, looking like a lightning in the slopes. With
thighs that is bigger than both my put together.






She is so good - and this after a really bad season where she haven't
won anything at all and we (swedes) all counted her out about the 1 nov.
But she proved us wrong and now she's defilating through the world cup.
In Åre, Sweden.




I am most impressed and hope that we all get inspired by her
personality, fighting spirit and joy in the slopes.
