I fell in love with
<a href="http://www.nancyfx.org/" target="_blank">Nancy</a> at first
sight; so slick, minimalistic, testable and understandable, powerful and
extendable when I need it. I later learned those features had a name;
the SuperDuperHappyPath and I've been on it ever sense I first laid eyes
on Nancy.

<a href="http://www.horsdal-consult.dk/" target="_blank">Christian
Horsdal</a> (one of the people that first showed me Nancy) had written a
<a href="http://bit.ly/IHouZT" target="_blank">book on Nancy</a> in the
style of Nancy. This is a great companion to every Nancy-developer. I
love the bundling in  recipes and how they are "graded" in from Simple
through Intermediate to Advanced.
Another thing that I really appreciate is that
Christian has adopted the Nancy-style of writing tests first. It's more
code to read, but I would suggest that you don't read it. Instead, type
along as you read the book and you will get a overview and understanding
of all the features of the Nancy framework. You'd probably find stuff
that Christian didn't mention too...

The code examples builds, reusable recipe by recipe, a nice little SPA
application with a Nancy API that, when finished, is hosted at AppHarbor
with Twitter authentication. The fact that the examples build on each
other doesn't hinder you from jumping in a later one since Christian has
supplied you with starting points in the code download (although the
numbering in my version of the download was a bit hard to figure out).

All in all this book is great! I would recommend it to anyone using
Nancy. I've been coding apps with Nancy and contributing code to the
framework itself for quite sometime and still; Christian showed me a
number of tricks that I didn't know of.

Thank you Christian for a great book! I know that I'll get back to it
and the recipes.
