Today i might have to eat my mobile (QTek 8100) and an indian
Nan-bread....

I have bet the IT-department at my customer that I would do that if the
test-team has finnished their testing in one day (which is the set
time).

Although they never has done that before i am still a bit nervous. It
looks really big and hard to ... "handle". I'll try to find a loophole
to get me out of it... maybe if i made a replica of marispan and ate it
really fast they wouldn't know the difference.
