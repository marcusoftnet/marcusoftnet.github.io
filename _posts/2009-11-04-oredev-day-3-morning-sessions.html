<h5>Accomplishing more by doing less</h5>  <p>This day started with Marc Lesser giving a keynote on “Accomplishing more by doing less”. This was a short overview of the day that I <a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2009/11/oredev-day-1-accomplishing-more-by.html" target="_blank">attended on Monday</a>, so it was some of the same, but also gave a crisper understanding of the subject. It was great to get a repetition for me.</p>  <p>Great quote of the day; Find “the One who are not busy”. In yourself, or God or whatever you read into it. I know what I do…</p>  <h5>Scrum – why it’s so hard to implement</h5>  <p>Jens Ödegaard gave this talk and it was one of those: “you’re not gonna get any silver bullets”, but rather a run through the challenges you face implementing Scrum. It was quite nice see that I wasn’t alone in my experiences. Here is some quotes that stuck:</p>  <ul>   <li>We want organizations that dare to let go of the old way of management.</li>    <li>The team is in this together – if you cannot do anything to help you can always show that you want it solved. If by no other means – bring coffee.</li>    <li>We didn’t have all these problems before Scrum. Well no. You had – but you didn’t see them.</li>    <li>A ScrumMaster should explain scrum to the rest of the organization.</li>    <li>A ScrumMaster is the teams best friend, removing impediments to help them focus on the task at hand.</li>    <li>A ScrumMaster has not authority. You have to coach people to commitment.</li>    <li>The daily scrum is a team meeting, not reporting to the Scrum Master. Scrum Master is not required to be there but rather make sure to be there</li>    <li>Define DONE together with the team and the Product Owner.</li> </ul>  <p>The end of the presentation was much better than the start which was very basic. It would have love to stayed longer on the “What to do?”-slide.</p>  <p>OK – that was not good. On to the next</p>  <h5>eXtreme programming in practice</h5>  <p>This session is given by <a href="http://www.nealford.com/" target="_blank">Neal Ford</a> and he’s a good presenter from what I understand.</p>  <ul>   <li>One of the things he mentioned is that XP works well because there are built on a series of feedback-loops on different time scales (minutes – pair programming, hours – unit tests, days – standups, weeks – iteration etc.)</li>    <li>He posed a new name for Non-functional requirements; Quality of Service. I like that.</li>    <li>Don’t ask how long will a task will take. Rather gauge complexity in a magnitude scale (1, 2, 4, 8, 16 etc.). And do it relative the other stories in the system</li>    <li>“All models are wrong, but some are useful” – true and funny.</li>    <li>Track initial estimate, “sprint” estimates (beginning of iteration) and actual values.</li>    <li>Every story is 0% until its 100% done. These criterias are expressed in business terms, hence user stories (As [X] I want [Y] <strong>because [Z]</strong>)</li>    <li>Truck number – the number of people that you cannot have hit by a truck. This number should be greater than 1 or your in trouble… Funny</li>    <li>YAGNI – Don’t build frameworks (on speculation). It’s better to extract a framework from a finished project.</li> </ul>  <p>This was a great presentation, also basic overview. On XP this time – I enjoyed that very much. Thank you Neal! The slides are for <a href="http://github.com/nealford" target="_blank">download here</a></p>  <p>This is a great conference and as always the best parts are in between sessions, talking to others.</p>
