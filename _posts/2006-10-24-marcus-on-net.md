This is my first ever publication on the Internet.

I am not sure yet what to put down here but I hope that it will be meaningful, for me if not for any other.

Today I will try to lead the future-group at my Salvation Army corps (church) after work. We are planning the activities for the corps in the future. A major rebuilding is in the planning and on the way so we also need to look over the "content" of the house.

I am so honored to be leading this team of nice and intelligent people.

So - that was the start.... Lets see where this leads.
