I just ended recording a podcast episode on the [Scrum Master Toolbox podcast](https://scrum-master-toolbox.org/), with [Vasco Duarte](https://twitter.com/duarte_vasco?) and together with a hero of mine: [Dan Vacanti](https://twitter.com/danvacanti). And the podcast took it's starting point in a project I [wrote about here earlier]([A data-driven prognosis report](https://www.marcusoft.net/2021/10/a-data-driven-prognosis-report.html)), and how I did a data driven forecasting approach to reporting progress on that project. I can tell you - I felt like a junior high having their science project reviewed by two university professors.

Until we got started talking - they both are very nice and very generous with their knowledge and help.

Anyway I wanted to share a little follow-up to the [that post](https://www.marcusoft.net/2021/10/a-data-driven-prognosis-report.html) I've written about the project and tell you how it went. You should read that post first, or I'll have to reiterate it all here.

### Did you make it on time?

Yes I did. I started to finish writing the material for the bootcamp about 3 weeks before it started. We are running it now, and it's actually going really well.

### Did you finish it when you thought you would?

Well no. Mostly because I didn't really have a good notion on when that would be. That's much the reason why I created this little data-driven forecasting in the first place.

How could I say a date when I thought I would finish? With any certainty? At the start of the project?

I couldn't. I didn't.

### How did it look at the end?

Being nerdy with graphs I actually took the time and created an animated version of the time-series data that shows how the forecasting changes, with more data. Both the wideness of the (worst-best case) which would indicate the certainty, but also the finished date.

Not how the distance between the lines grows smaller and smaller with each added data point. And at the end it is not affect much by new data at all.

## Summary - was it useful?

This reporting was super useful. Both for me to keep track on my own progress and work status, but even more when it comes to talk with people interested in the progress.

When people asked `Will you make it?` I could rather than to give a Yes or No answer have a good discussion based on data, and make adjustments to my workload appropriately.

And I got to talk about it on a podcast... :)
