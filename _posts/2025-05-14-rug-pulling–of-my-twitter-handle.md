My old twitter handle `marcusoftnet` is being used by someone that is not me.

Don't trust a word they are saying. It's a scam. I deleted that account a year after Elon took over Twitter. Since then I haven't used it. I have, however, used this handle on other sites and this blog - and it's become my official handle on the internet.

They are stealing content from my LinkedIn to make it look more like me. With this content and over the course of a few months they have created a trustworthy profile and accumulated a few thousand followers.

Then they launched a crypto-currency with my employers name. So ... yeah... that's one way to introduce yourself as a newly employed person at a company. (More on that below)

I got informed about this while getting a few emails asking if the currency is legit. It's not. This stunt is referred to as rug-pulling (or pump-and-dump); build up trust, get investors and then exit directly.

It's a scam all of it. Don't belive a thing x.com/marcusoftnet is saying. It's not me.

I have reported it to Twitter as an impersonation, reported the account and will report the thing to the police.

My employer has been nothing but supportive and helpful, loads of colleagues reaching out and giving virtual and physical support.

## Update

The account is now closed, the crypto has tanked (losing the scammer $10.000) and I have reported the account to Police.
