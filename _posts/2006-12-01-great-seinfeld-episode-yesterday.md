One of the Swedish TV-channels is reprising Seinfeld-episodes over
and over again and is on the third (fourth?) lap round all the seasons
now.

But there are still some great stuff in there. In this episode George
pretends to be a marine biologist to impress a girl and of course get
into trouble. This is the end of it. It so great.
