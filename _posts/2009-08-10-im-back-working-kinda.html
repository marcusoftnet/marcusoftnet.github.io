Sooo - the parental leave is now over. I have spent six months "not-working" and together with my son, Albert. It has been great but when looking back it seem like the time has passed very fast.<div><br /><div>OK - so now I am offically back in business. Well, by the way, let's see if there is anything for me to do first. Otherwise I'll be "free" for a little while longer. We'll see.</div><div><br /></div><div>What I have done so far is just updated my CV. That's always rewarding since it seems like you have done a lot of important work...</div><div><br /></div><div>And now I have put way to much time into installing <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/">Windows 7</a>. I have had a real hard time to do it from a USB-stick. But here is a <a href="http://kmwoley.com/blog/?p=345">great a description</a> on how to install Windows 7 from USB-stick.</div><div><br /></div><div>From that I'll try to <a href="http://blogs.combitech.se/salmi/archive/2009/05/18/visual-studio-2010-beta-slaumlppt.aspx">install Visual Studio 2010</a> and learn some more about it. The <a href="http://blogs.conchango.com/gracemollison/archive/2009/07/28/tfs-a-tale-of-two-versions.aspx">new build defintion</a> and <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/jakob/archive/2009/05/27/working-with-build-definitions-in-tfs-team-build-2010.aspx">working with it</a> looks... interesting. I am sure about it yet... I'll get back to you on that.</div></div>
