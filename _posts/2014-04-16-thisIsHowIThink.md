I recently had a wake-up call when I realized that some of my fundamental thoughts aren't as clear to others as they are to me. This realization prompted deep reflection on what matters to me and how I approach my work, striving to guide others with these principles.

My ideas aren't groundbreaking; they simply prioritize producing value for someone, often referred to as "the customer." This customer could be anyone benefiting from our work, including ourselves. Value isn't solely monetary; it encompasses any positive impact, even personal well-being.

### Why Are We Here?

For me, the question of purpose underpins everything we do. Though we may have various reasons for being in a workplace, the primary goal is to produce value. This aligns with the Salvation Army's ethos: "Others!" We're here to serve someone, whether external customers or colleagues.

Understanding value is crucial. It's not just about profit but encompasses any benefit our actions yield. Reflecting on how our work impacts the customer and striving for improvement is essential.

### Small and Fast

I advocate for delivering value swiftly and incrementally. Small, frequent deliveries enhance learning and build trust with customers. Progress, even in modest increments, demonstrates commitment and keeps momentum.

### Getting Things Done Quickly

Efficiency matters, but not at the expense of quality. Speed should never compromise the end result. Completing tasks promptly while maintaining quality is the ideal balance.

### Doing Less, Doing Better

Focusing on fewer tasks at once accelerates progress. It's a mathematical reality that reducing workload increases efficiency. Simplicity and focus are keys to effectiveness.

### Embracing Change

Continuous improvement is non-negotiable. We must challenge existing practices, striving for better ways of working. Adapting to change, even when uncomfortable, is essential for growth.

### Empowering Individuals

Decentralizing decision-making empowers those closest to the work to effect change. Trusting employees to make informed decisions fosters innovation and accelerates progress.

### The Human Element

Amidst our drive for efficiency, we mustn't overlook the human aspect. Respecting individuals and fostering a supportive environment are foundational to success.

### Final Thoughts

Our purpose is clear: to create value for others. This journey involves constant self-reflection, challenging the status quo, and embracing change. While my perspective may differ from yours, my aim is not to impose but to foster understanding and growth.

This post reflects my thinking; I welcome constructive dialogue and differing viewpoints. Ultimately, our shared goal is progressâ€”for ourselves and those we serve.
