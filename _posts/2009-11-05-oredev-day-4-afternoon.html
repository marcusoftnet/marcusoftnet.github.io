<p>I’m still feeling a bit exhausted from the last Dan North talk. Now we will have some more down-to-earth code stuff. </p>  <h5>Putting the M of ASP.NET MVC with Scott Allen</h5>  <p><a href="http://odetocode.com" target="_blank">Scott</a> started off by defining the purpose of the model is, who does it serve? </p>  <ul>   <li>Business objects are great if you build a wrapper on SQL Management Studio ;) </li>    <li>The model can be found serving two master – both the view and the business logic. </li>    <li>The answer to the above is too create a view model. But that can give you a lot of classes. I (and Scott) think that will be worth it – because every class now have a well defined responsibility.&#160; </li>    <li>Cool – you can define an interface that decides what properties to bind when using <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd470756.aspx" target="_blank">TryUpdateModel&lt;T&gt;</a> </li>    <li>Don’t use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.mvc.imodelbinder.aspx" target="_blank">IModelBinder</a> to bind your own models because you’ll have to write much code. Instead override <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.mvc.defaultmodelbinder.onmodelupdated.aspx" target="_blank">OnModelUpdated</a> on the default model binder and add only to things that differs from the default binding… Great tip! The binders are to be registered in Application_Start. </li>    <li>The controller should not really bind the model – it’s not it’s responsible for that stuff. A controller should only orchestrate the application parts </li>    <li>In ASP.NET MVC we’ll have the possibility to use <a href="http://stephenwalther.com/blog/archive/2008/09/10/asp-net-mvc-tip-43-use-data-annotation-validators.aspx" target="_blank">DataAnnotations</a> </li>    <li>Cool – <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/yb52a4x0.aspx" target="_blank">EnableClientSideValidation</a> to create JavaScript validation from your server side validation </li> </ul>  <p>Yeah I learned a lot of things here. Thanks Scott! </p>  <h5>Specification workshops</h5>  <p>From the program this should be on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_Driven_Development" target="_blank">BDD</a> which I like, so I hope that will learn more on it. The <a href="http://gojko.net/about/" target="_blank">speaker</a> is very passionate and fun.&#160; </p>  <ul>   <li>Customer looking at code is as looking of things produced by <a href="http://www.mrklingon.org">www.mrklingon.org</a></li>    <li>“How experts think” was dropped as “the most important book I’ve read.</li>    <li>“I am the only one in the room that have hade the privilege to be bombed by a B2-bomber…” Eeeeh.</li>    <li>Ask the question Why? more often in software projects.</li>    <li>Requirements are often given as a solution to an unknown problem. A story of people requesting a printout to be able to type into another system made that point very clear.</li>    <li>On-site customer is a ROLE not a single know-it-all-person. Such a person doesn’t exists.</li>    <li>Collaborate on specifications – business people, test, developers. Do it everybody together.</li>    <li>Do it by discussing examples – you don’t need to write it down but use to drive the specifications. Example writing workshops or Specification workshop (or any name that scare them enough to come)</li>    <li>Run the workshop</li>    <ul>     <li>Choose a story</li>      <li>Introduce it, explain with examples</li>      <li>Let people ask question and suggest other examples</li>      <li>Discuss until everyone is confident that we have enough examples to start working</li>   </ul>    <li>This leads to a shared domain knowledge and evolving the ubiquitous language</li> </ul>  <p>This was great! Thanks <a href="http://gojko.net/about/" target="_blank">Gojko</a>.</p>
