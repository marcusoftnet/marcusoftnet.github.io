There is a famous brass band / marching competition in Great Britain
called Whit Friday. There are loads and loads of bands taking part and
they march up to a small village do a march and then continue on. Most
bands do more than 15 events like this during the day.

There really fun part of it is that bands of all sorts take part from
the most famous to the ...eh.. not so famous.

Here is a short clip of Black Dyke doing a march in Delph. Take special
notice of the tuba players in the front. I could carry one of those
tubas for a minute, not to mention how it would be to play it...
