[Avega](http://www.avega.se) is starting up a [corporate blog](http://blog.avegagroup.se) and have asked me to post some posts there. Sounds great so I have just posted in some items from [www.marcusoft.net](https://www.marcusoft.net) to my ["Avega"-alias](blogg.avega.se/marcushammarberg).

<http://blog.avegagroup.se> will not be live in a few weeks though, so keep cool until you can read me in ... stereo. ;)

A few interesting questions arose:

- How will [Google](http://www.google.com) tackle the indexing. Will a search for "marcus hammarberg" yeild a hit at the Avega-blog before [www.marcusoft.net](https://www.marcusoft.net)?
- How to use [Windows Live Write](http://get.live.com/writer/overview) (which I have fallen in love with) with [SubText.NET](http://subtextproject.com/) (the Avega blog engine of choice)? Luckily there is a [simple solution here.](http://blogs.meetandplay.com/WPierce/archive/2006/08/18/SubText_and_Windows_Live_Writer.aspx)
