We break for something different. This is not my normal IT/agile/lean post. It's about God and his care for me

Happy that you continued to read.

I've been having some hard days at work. I was very angry and it affected not only me but also those around me. Also I was being affected physically with dizziness and head ache. For the first time in my life I found it better to go home and cool off a couple of days.

I felt so tired and was beginning to doubt if I'm really doing the right thing. In the right place.

So I did things that pick me up. Playing hymns on my euphonium is one of those things. My playing is closely related to my faith, since I've made most religious experiences with my instrument in hand, playing in the most cases.

What happened this time was Gods way of saying: I got you, man. Keep going. I've got you.

I brought forth the trusty old Salvation Army Band Tune Book, where the music to all the songs the Salvation Army use can be found. I flipped through some pages and ended up on song number 544. There's 3-5 songs per page. 544 is How Great Thou art. It speaks about God greatness and that he has created all things.

> Then sings my soul, my saviour God to thee
> How great Thou art.

The next song is an old english song called: I know a fount. Here's the first verse:

> Say, are you weary? Are you heavy laden?
> Burdened with sorrow, weighted down with care?
> Are you in bondage? Do you want deliverance?
> Come, then, with me, there is refuge from despair.

And the chorus talks about burden being lifted by the grace and mercy of Jesus sacrifice for me. That I didn't deserved:

> I know a fount where sins are washed away,
> I know a place where night is turned to day;
> Burdens are lifted, blind eyes made to see;
> There's a wonder-working power in the blood of Calvary.

At this point I was filled with God presence. I felt so warm, cared for and lifted in my spirit. The next song: "Just where He needs me":

> Just where he needs me, my Lord has placed me,
> Just where he needs me, there would I be!
> And since he found me, by love heâ€™s bound me
> To serve him joyfully.

I stopped playing after that.

I'm still "weary" and "heavy laden" ... only difference after this message is; I know God knows. He showed his care for me. I know he's raising me up to serve Him joyfully. I know that he needs me where I am.

The blog will now go back to normal type of posts.
