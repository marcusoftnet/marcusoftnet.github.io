This weekend I've been hanging around brass players, and they tipped me off about a really nerdy game - [Tuba Hero](http://contest.infrasec.se/expert/) - a brass version of [Guitar Hero](http://www.guitarhero.com/).

Great fun - although the record (108880 at the current time) is way out of my reach.
