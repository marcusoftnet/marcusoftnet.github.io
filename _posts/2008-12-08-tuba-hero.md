This weekend I've hanged around brass players and they tipped me on a
really nerdy game -
<a href="http://contest.infrasec.se/expert/" target="_blank">Tuba
Hero</a> - a brass version of
<a href="http://www.guitarhero.com/" target="_blank">Guitar Hero</a>.

Great fun - although the record (108880 at the current time) is way out
of my reach.
