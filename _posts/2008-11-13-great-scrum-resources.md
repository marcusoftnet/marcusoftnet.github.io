The Swedish guru of Scrum Henrik Kniberg, has produced some great
stuff... yet again. Here you are:

-   <a
    href="http://blog.crisp.se/henrikkniberg/2008/08/23/1219509120000.html"
    target="_blank">Video</a> and <a
    href="http://www.crisp.se/henrik.kniberg/presentations/agile2008/10-ways-to-screw-up-with-scrum-and-xp.pdf"
    target="_blank">slides</a> for "10 ways to screw up with Scrum and
    XP". Got the merge-slide thrown in my face of a co-worker since I
    have great reluctantancy against branches... But I sure want to be
    able to manage them in a nice way - haven't seen one yet though...
-   <a
    href="http://www.crisp.se/henrik.kniberg/scrum/checklist/Scrum-checklist-prio1.pdf"
    target="_blank">Scrum checklist</a> - here is a truly great one page
    document to get all your stuff in the right shape before starting
    doing Scrum.
-   And of course
    <a href="http://www.infoq.com/minibooks/scrum-xp-from-the-trenches"
    target="_blank">Scrum from the trenches</a>. Everybody must read
    this! Even, or maybe especially, if you hate Scrum.
