The Swedish guru of Scrum, Henrik Kniberg, has produced some great stuff... yet again. Here you are:

- [Video](http://blog.crisp.se/henrikkniberg/2008/08/23/1219509120000.html) and [slides](http://www.crisp.se/henrik.kniberg/presentations/agile2008/10-ways-to-screw-up-with-scrum-and-xp.pdf) for "10 ways to screw up with Scrum and XP". Got the merge-slide thrown in my face of a co-worker since I have great reluctance against branches... But I sure want to be able to manage them in a nice way - haven't seen one yet though...
- [Scrum checklist](http://www.crisp.se/henrik.kniberg/scrum/checklist/Scrum-checklist-prio1.pdf) - here is a truly great one-page document to get all your stuff in the right shape before starting doing Scrum.
- And of course [Scrum from the trenches](http://www.infoq.com/minibooks/scrum-xp-from-the-trenches). Everybody must read this! Even, or maybe especially, if you hate Scrum.
