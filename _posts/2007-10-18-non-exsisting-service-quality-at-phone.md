I can't hold it in anymore. The service quality of The Phone House
is bugging me enough to write them an angry email and enclose this
service.

About 8 months ago i bought the most expensive telephone in my life,
4000 SEK. It was an HTC MTeoR. I have used HTC before and was
recommended by the salesman at The Phone House that it was a good
choice. Little did i know...

However - after a few months some problem did occur. When the phone rang
it all of a sudden just lost it's net. When i rebooted it the net was
there again. Annoying but no problemos - that can happen.

I went to The Phone House to get some help. I was very surprised when i
did get to give them the phone until i tried for the third time. Their
excuses "Have you tried to patch it?", "Try another phone on the same
place" etc.

But finally i was granted permission to leave my mobile at The Phone
House for repairs. The telephone i got to borrow during my absence of my
4000 SEK HTC was a Motorola that must be five or six years old. No T9,
that's who old it is.

Three weeks later (apparently that is "what you can expect from HTC...
Anything from one to three weeks.") i got my phone back. The clerk
happily informed me that "They haven't changed a thing! Just updated the
software". That's promising... When you leave your mobile for an network
loss error that is not what i would bet on would fix the problem. But
ok - let's try it!

A week passed and, you guessed it, the phone still didn't work. Back to
The Phone House at Gallerian. "Same problem" - i said, "Can i please get
a new phone or fix this one?". "No let's try to change your SIM-card",
the salesman of The Phone House told me.

We tried that. I didn't think that would do the trick. I didn't.

Back to the The Phone House. "Can i please get a new phone or fix this
one, please. With sugar on top?"
"Well, you know, you have to leave it THREE TIMES for the same error
before the can take it back. And also... that isn't their best model..."
(Sounds promising, doesn't it?)

So i left the phone again. They switched the "mainboard" which i take as
being pretty much the whole phone except the shell... Which it's the
saleswoman of The Phone House confirmed.

(At this point in time The Phone House also though that it was a good
idea to try to sell my a new home telephone subscription. They are so
funny with their feeble tries...)

A week and a half later - the phone is back! This time, i thought to
myself, it must work. Fingers crossed and spitting over my shoulder.

But... no - a day later. Still same problem. I went back to The Phone
House and thought that now they must take the phone back. "Na na na...
three times" How could i forget?

So now it's back there again. And I'll bet that it won't work when it's
back. But is it reasonable that you need to leave it three times for the
same error? No - i don't think.

And the most sad thing in this story is that the people working there is
not the problem they are of course only acting on orders. So this is how
The Phone House want to be understood... As very hard to get the service
you want from. Not for me thank you.
