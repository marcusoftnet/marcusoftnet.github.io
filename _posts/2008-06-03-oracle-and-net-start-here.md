I've
actually managed to avoid using Oracle through my now 10 years as a
consultant. Up to now - and now I am really looking forward to it.

Here are some starters that I've found useful as introductions:


-   [Learn Oracle and .NET in 2
    days](http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B25329_01/doc/appdev.102/b25312.pdf) -
    from Oracle
-   [Oracle .NET developer
    center](http://www.oracle.com/technology/tech/dotnet/index.html)
-   [Oracle
    introduction](http://www.oracle.com/technology/obe/net11gobe/building.net/vs_otn2.htm)
    to building .NET applications with ODT
-   [Oracle Developer Tools for Visual
    Studio](http://www.oracle.com/technology/tech/dotnet/tools/index.html)
    (with some nice links)

My... that was not a very long list. I promise to update it as I read...

**\[UPDATED\]
**The list is a bit longer now... Still not impressive though
