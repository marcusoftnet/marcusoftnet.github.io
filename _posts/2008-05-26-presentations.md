Today is kind of a special day at work. After the normal work day we have invited my customer to [Avega](http://www.avega.se/) for an evening of some, hopefully interesting and fun presentation.

Why I am hoping this is because I am doing the presentations, and the "fun" part.

The first part is a SOA-presentation together with a colleague - Robert SÃ¶dergren. Here we will try to answer the not-so-easy-answered-question "What is SOA?".

For the fun is something even more nerve-wrecking; I often take the opportunity to play my euphonium and tell people little about the Salvation Army. Nothing special there. But this time I have chosen to end the session by playing the infamous [Carnival of Venice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnival_of_Venice_%28song%29), by Arban.

I know - it's my own choice and all that - but it was a bit harder than I expected to get it up to ["wow"-factor](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aqw8v1ILB2g). I am not quite sure I am there yet - to be honest. I'll get back to you.
