This might be a no-brainer for most of you, but I have to put it up here since I'll have to run back to it from time to time.

Here is how to run "any" program as another user, without any [installs or modifications](https://www.marcusoft.net/2008/08/run-as-for-msi-files.html):

1. Type **cmd** in the Run box of the Start menu.
1. Type the following command:

   ```text
   runas /user:[domain][user] [program]
   ```

   Of course, exchange [domain], [user], and [program] to the things you'll need. For example, to start Management Console as MARCUSADMIN:

   ```text
   runas /user:MARCUSOFT\MARCUSADMIN mmc
   ```

1. Type the password of the user you want to run under.
1. Voila! You are running the program as the other user.
