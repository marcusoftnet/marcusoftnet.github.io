Tomorrow we have the last demo of the project. It feels great when you
think of what we have accomplished in this short while:

- 4-5 persons
- 6 months (including the famous Swedish vacation month of 6 weeks)
- 100 000 lines of code
- Implementing and learning new architecture and
    Scrum

I am really proud of the project and the members in it. Thank you guys
for the opportunity to do this together.
