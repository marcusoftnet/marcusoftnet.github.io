Tomorrow we have the last demo of the project. It feels great when you
think of what we have accomplished in this short while:

-   4-5 persons
-   6 months (including the famous Swedish <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0"
    class="blsp-spelling-corrected">vacation</span> month of 6 weeks)
-   100 000 lines of code
-   Implementing and <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1"
    class="blsp-spelling-corrected">learning</span> new architecture and
    Scrum

I am really proud of the project and the members in it. Thank you guys
for the <span>="blsp-spelling-corrected">opportunity</span> to do this together.
