I am
from today starting a period with some really weird stuff on my
schedule:

-   Today i will be a Santa at Elins work. I have never done the
    Santa-stuff before, will have to choose a voice later today
-   Tomorrow i will give a presentation on SOA (Service Oriented
    Architecture). This is scary since so many people have things to say
    about it. I have prepared and hope that it will work out alright.
-   Saturday - playing with the Salvation Army. Typical Christmas stuff
    for me and a lot of people in the world.
-   On Sunday there is a gig with the Vasa Band in some church. It will
    be fun
-   And then to top things of with - on Tuesday the 19th the Vasa Band
    will be "door" number 19 in the "advent"-calender in the Old Town in
    Stockholm

As I said a lot of really different and weird stuff. But all of them are
fun. I hope I will have time to buy some Christmas presents also.
