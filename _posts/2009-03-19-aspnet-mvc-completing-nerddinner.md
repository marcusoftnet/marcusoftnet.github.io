I am now done with the run-through the walkthrough for the
<a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/" target="_blank">ASP.NET MVC</a> book
I’ve talked about <a
href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2009/03/aspnet-mvc-nerd-dinner-example.html"
target="_blank">before</a>.

The first thing to notice is how great this way of introducing a subject
is/was. 196 pages of really interesting examples and code. Really
looking forward to the complete book.

Secondly I’ve picked up some really useful and interesting techniques
surrounding ASP.NET MVC:

-   The UpdateModel-method, or rather not using it. You can specify an
    inparameter to an ActionMethod (of the same type as in the View) and
    the framework will fill it out with data from the form.
-   There are some really useful attributes in the framework, such as
    Authorize.

I also learned some lessons surrounding my repositories that I’ll need
to include in the sprint planner helper project. I’ll get back to that…
