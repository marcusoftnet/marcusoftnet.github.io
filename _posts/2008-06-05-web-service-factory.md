Following a tip from Robert I've been checking out the [Web Service Factory](http://www.codeplex.com/servicefactory) tool from [Microsoft's Patterns and Practices](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/practices/default.aspx) gang.

Robert and I were discussing the use of [Contract First design](http://static.springframework.org/spring-ws/site/reference/html/why-contract-first.html) in an upcoming project and I was interested to see if there were any good tools out there.

Well as it turns out there are good [tools](http://www.thinktecture.com/Resources/Software/WSContractFirst/default.html)... but the one that seemed to be most complete was the [Web Service Factory](http://www.codeplex.com/servicefactory) (horrendous name, by the way...). Also for us Microsoft-coders the PoP-gang is well-known and often delivers with great quality.

I have now been checking it out and it is good. Here is some of the stuff I've been checking out

- [The home of Web Service Factory](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb931187.aspx) (and the [Codeplex home](http://www.codeplex.com/servicefactory))
- [Introduction](http://www.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ProjectName=servicefactory&ReleaseId=7845)
- [A video showing off some features](http://www.microsoft.com/belux/msdn/nl/chopsticks/default.aspx?id=307)

I am not yet convinced that we will go this way (the completeness is maybe too great fiddling with servers etc.) but it sure looks good.
