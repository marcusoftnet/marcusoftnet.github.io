Following
a tip from Robban I've been checking out the [Web Service
Factory](http://www.codeplex.com/servicefactory) tool from [Microsofts
Patterns and
Practices](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/practices/default.aspx)
gang.

Robban and I were discussing the use of [Contract First
design](http://static.springframework.org/spring-ws/site/reference/html/why-contract-first.html)
in an upcoming project and I was interested to see if there were any
good tools out there.

Well as it turns out there are good
[tools](http://www.thinktecture.com/Resources/Software/WSContractFirst/default.html)...
but the one that seemed to be most complete was the [Web Service
Factory](http://www.codeplex.com/servicefactory) (horrendous name, by
the way...). Also for us Microsoft-coders the PoP-gang is well-known and
often delivers with great quality.

I have now been checking it out and it is good. Here is some of the
stuff I've been checking out

-   [The home of Web Service
    Factory](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb931187.aspx)
    (and the [Codeplex home](http://www.codeplex.com/servicefactory))
-   [Introduction](http://www.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ProjectName=servicefactory&ReleaseId=7845)
-   [A video showing off some
    features](http://www.microsoft.com/belux/msdn/nl/chopsticks/default.aspx?id=307)

I am not yet convinced that we will go this way (the completeness is
maybe too great fiddling with servers etc.) but it sure looks good.
