<p>As you could read in my <a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2010/01/aspnet-mvc-structuremap-and-tdd.html" target="_blank">latest post</a> I have be a bit frustrated with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development" target="_blank">TDD</a> and where to start, lately. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_Driven_Development" target="_blank">BDD</a> is of course the answer to that. But I must say that the frameworks are available to the .NET crowd is a bit weird. Either you have some really <a href="http://andersjonsson.blogspot.com/2009/05/stapplande-steg-med-mspec.html" target="_blank">funky syntax</a> (hey Anders, a new colleague and great guy) or it’s build on top on <a href="http://gojko.net/2010/01/01/bdd-in-net-with-cucumber-cuke4nuke-and-teamcity/" target="_blank">other stuff</a> and where hard to work with.</p>  <p>I simply cannot see myself introduce any ordinary programmers to any of that. </p>  <p>But here is something that looks more like it… a bit at least; <a href="http://www.specflow.org/" target="_blank">SpecFlow</a>. It’s also built with an eye too <a href="http://rspec.info/" target="_blank">RSpec</a>, <a href="http://cukes.info/" target="_blank">Cucumber</a> and Ruby but build in the style of .NET and C#. </p>  <p>Here is a <a href="http://www.specflow.org/specflow/screencast.aspx" target="_blank">(silent) screencast</a>, something about <a href="http://www.specflow.org/specflow/workflow.aspx" target="_blank">syntax and workflow</a> and some <a href="http://www.specflow.org/about/background.aspx" target="_blank">great resources</a>.</p>  <p><a href="http://github.com/techtalk/SpecFlow/tree/master/Tests/ParserTests/" target="_blank">From this</a> it even looks that they support Swedish… Great work <a href="http://www.specflow.org/about/people.aspx" target="_blank">guys!</a></p>  <p>I’ll be sure to look into this a bit more. Later. New assignment today.</p>
