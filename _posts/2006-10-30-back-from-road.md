Returned to Stockholm from a small tour... exhausted of course.

Funny how playing and spending so much time together bonds you and makes
new friends. I really had a great time with the band.

The playing from the band also took of, and became better and better.
For me too, even though a major split spoiled the very last note of the
encore. Really embarrassing, but hey - that's
life.

Gave (swedish expression) blood on my
tooth though. More. More practice!
