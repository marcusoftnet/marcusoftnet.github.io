I love the [snippet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snippet_(programming)) support in Visual Studio. It’s so much a part of what we do that we don’t even think about it anymore. Just like [Intellisense](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IntelliSense) way, way back – remember the time before that?

But one thing that always has been a bit messy is creating your own. And that Snippet manager – what is that? I’ve never been able to get to like it.

But there is help on the way; meet [Snippet Designer](http://www.codeplex.com/SnippetDesigner). It can help you not only to [create snippets from existing code](http://www.codeplex.com/SnippetDesigner#What%20can%20the%20Snippet%20Designer%20do?), but also to manage your snippets in a nice way.
