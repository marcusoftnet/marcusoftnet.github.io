I love the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snippet_(programming)"
target="_blank">snippet</a> support in Visual Studio. It’s so much a
part of what we do that we don’t even think about it anymore. Just like
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IntelliSense"
target="_blank">Intellisense</a> way, way back – remember the time
before that?

But one thing that always has been bit messy is to create your own. And
that Snippet manager – what is that? I’ve never been able to get to like
it.

But there is help on the way; meet
<a href="http://www.codeplex.com/SnippetDesigner"
target="_blank">Snippet Designer</a>. It can help you not only to <a
href="http://www.codeplex.com/SnippetDesigner#What%20can%20the%20Snippet%20Designer%20do?"
target="_blank">create snippets from existing code</a>, but also to
manage your snippets in a nice way.
