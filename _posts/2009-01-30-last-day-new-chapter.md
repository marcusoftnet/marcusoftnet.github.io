I have come to a fork in the road of my life (that almost sound like a
poem :)).

Today is the last day on the assignment where I have, as ever, learned a
lot. This time I have picked up
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture"
target="_blank">SOA</a>,
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/aa663324.aspx"
target="_blank">WCF</a>,
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/tfs2008/default.aspx"
target="_blank">TFS</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming"
target="_blank">AOP</a> and build scripts - and of course
<a href="http://www.controlchaos.com/" target="_blank">SCRUM</a>.

The Scrum part of this was almost a religious experience.Â  I am a
different and better consultant after learning SCRUM. I won't ever go
back.

The future hold six months together with <a

target="_blank">Albert and Elin</a>. I will be "daddy-free" (direct
translation of "pappaledig" for all you Swedish readers). This is a
truly amazing thing that we have in Sweden where you actually get money
from the government to be home with your kids. Amazing!

Elin is working nights right now which means that she has a lot of free
time during days. This means that we can be together a lot which I am
really looking forward to.

So that's my agenda for the next six months; daddy-free! See ya!

PS.
I have just bought <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882"
target="_blank">Clean Code</a> and <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Enterprise-Application-Architecture-Addison-Wesley-Signature/dp/0321127420"
target="_blank">Patterns of Enterprise Architecture</a> - so I will read
them. Also I have plans on starting a little hobby project to learn
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDD" target="_blank">DDD</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development"
target="_blank">TDD</a> and
<a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/" target="_blank">ASP.NET MVC</a>. I'll
get back to you on that - if I do that...
