I have come to a fork in the road of my life (that almost sounds like a poem :)).

Today is my last day on this assignment, where I've learned a lot. This time, I’ve delved into [SOA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture), [WCF](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/aa663324.aspx), [TFS](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/tfs2008/default.aspx), [AOP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming), and build scripts, along with [SCRUM](http://www.controlchaos.com/).

The SCRUM part of this experience was almost a religious one. I feel like a different and better consultant after learning SCRUM, and I don’t think I'll ever go back.

The future holds six months with Albert and Elin. I will be "daddy-free" (a direct translation of "pappaledig" for all you Swedish readers). This is a wonderful benefit in Sweden where you actually receive money from the government to stay home with your kids. Amazing!

Elin is working nights right now, which means she has a lot of free time during the day. This allows us to spend a lot of time together, something I am really looking forward to.

So that’s my agenda for the next six months: daddy-free! See you!

**P.S.**

I’ve just bought [Clean Code](http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) and [Patterns of Enterprise Architecture](http://www.amazon.com/Enterprise-Application-Architecture-Addison-Wesley-Signature/dp/0321127420) - so I’ll be reading those. I also plan to start a little hobby project to explore [DDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDD), [TDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development), and [ASP.NET MVC](http://www.asp.net/mvc/). I’ll update you on that if I follow through.
