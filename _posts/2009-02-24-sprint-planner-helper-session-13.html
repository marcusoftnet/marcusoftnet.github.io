<p>After some consideration I have decided to follow the <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/" target="_blank">ASP.NET MVC</a> best practices quite closely – and do the listing of the products as a separate page, the Index-method on the Product Controller. </p>  <p>I’ll focus on this before the actual adding is fleshed out. This is because the Create-method of the ProductController do a redirect to the Index-action. </p>  <p>Also I will keep the GUI very simple. If I do the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller" target="_blank">MVC</a>-ing right it will be easy for anyone who knows this.</p>  <p>[Wait one hour – Marcus is coding :)]</p>  <p>I actually got a product added today! And the more I work with TDD, DDD and ASP.NET MVC the more right it feels. <a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2009/02/why-ddd-rocks-marcusoftnet-version.html" target="_blank">Read this</a> and you’ll see what I mean.</p>  <p>I will have to create a factory for products… but my hour is up.</p>
