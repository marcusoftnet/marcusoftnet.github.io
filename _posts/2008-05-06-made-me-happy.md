Here is two short videos that made me happy in the morning. The first is
a song with Oh Laura. The lead is performed by a friend of mine, JÃ¶rgen
Kjellgren.

The second one is a ... well prank, maybe. Some people has put up some
signs in a Arabic town which says things like "Stop here if you rather
have been in bed" or "Turn around twice in the roundabout if your are
happy". Then they have filmed the result. It's quite gratifying to
watch.

And no-one is getting hurt, no misfortune is happing to anyone. And
still it's funny. Just think...
