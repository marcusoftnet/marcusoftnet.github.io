Here are two short videos that made me happy in the morning. The first is a song with Oh Laura. The lead is performed by a friend of mine, JÃ¶rgen Kjellgren.

The second one is a... well, prank, maybe. Some people have put up some signs in an Arabic town which say things like "Stop here if you would rather have been in bed" or "Turn around twice in the roundabout if you are happy." Then they have filmed the result. It's quite gratifying to watch.

And no one is getting hurt, no misfortune is happening to anyone. And still, it's funny. Just think...
