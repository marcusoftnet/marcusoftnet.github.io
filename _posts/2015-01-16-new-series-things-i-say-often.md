New year - new blog series. I was thinking about writing down some of the things that I find myself repeating often.

These post will be short, and possible link to places where I've already said this already.

I will collect these post under the label [Things I say often](http://www.marcusoft.net/tags/#Things I say often)

I don't have a list made up already, so I'll write things when they pop into my head. Here's first things I that sprung to mind.

- [This is your board - change it](http://www.marcusoft.net/2015/01/this-is-your-board---change-it.html)
- [Why?](http://www.marcusoft.net/2015/01/things-i-say-often-why.html)
- [Improving means changing] (http://www.marcusoft.net/2015/01/improving_means_changing.html)
- [NO! This is how you tear off a post-it](http://www.marcusoft.net/2015/01/this-is-how-you-tear-off-a-post-it.html)
- [I don't care about efficiency until we know our goal](http://www.marcusoft.net/2015/01/i-dont-care-about-efficiency-until-we-know-our-goal.html)
- [I run on feedback](http://www.marcusoft.net/2015/01/i-run-on-feedback.html)
- [Leadership - not management](http://www.marcusoft.net/2015/01/leadership---not-management.html)

I hope you will enjoy this series. I know I will benefit from writing some of these down.
