New year - new blog series. I was thinking about writing down some of the things that I find myself repeating often.

These post will be short, and possible link to places where I've already said this already.

I will collect these post under the label [Things I say often](http://www.marcusoft.net/tags/#Things I say often)

I don't have a list made up already, so I'll write things when they pop into my head. Here's first things I that sprung to mind.

- [This is your board - change it](/2015/01/this-is-your-board---change-it.html)
- [Why?](/2015/01/things-i-say-often-why.html)
- [Improving means changing] (/2015/01/improving_means_changing.html)
- [NO! This is how you tear off a post-it](/2015/01/this-is-how-you-tear-off-a-post-it.html)
- Efficiency is not important if you don't know your goal
- I run on feedback
- [Leadership - not management](/2015/01/leadership---not-management.html)
- Really?! Expert maker of mistakes

I hope you will enjoy this series. I know I will benefit from writing some of these down.
