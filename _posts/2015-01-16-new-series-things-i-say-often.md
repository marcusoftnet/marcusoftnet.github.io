New year - new blog series. I was thinking about writing down some of the things that I find myself repeating often.

These post will be short, and possible link to places where I've already said this already.

I will collect these post under the label [Things I say often](http://www.marcusoft.net/tags/#Things I say often)

I don't have a list made up already, so I'll write things when they pop into my head. Here's first things I that sprung to mind.

- [This is your board - change it](http://www.marcusoft.net/2015/01/this-is-your-board---change-it.html)
- Why?
- I'm talking about changing
- This is how you tear off a post-it
- Efficiency is not important if you don't know your goal
- I run on feedback
- Leadership - not management

I hope you will enjoy this series. I know I will benefit from writing some of these down.
