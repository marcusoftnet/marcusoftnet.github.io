<p>This has been the longest of my sessions so far and by far. It has actually stretched over 4 separate “hours” and almost a week since my schedule has been busy with other stuff. </p>  <p>It had to do with me getting stuck on a thing the ASP.NET MVC framework that I didn’t get. This was related to the way the framework binds the data in the view to the values posted, and the UpdateModel method etc. </p>  <p>To make a long story short I have <a href="http://forums.asp.net/t/1402763.aspx" target="_blank">posted an item</a> in the <a href="http://forums.asp.net/1146.aspx" target="_blank">MVC-forum</a>, and got some truly great feedback from Alberto. I recommend you <a href="http://forums.asp.net/t/1402763.aspx" target="_blank">reading it.</a> Go on. Do it now.</p>  <p>Ok – from all this I learned some very useful lessons; </p>  <ul>   <li>the most important was to use a separate ViewModel. That is – create classes that are streamlined to fit the view that the controller is exposing. </li>    <li>you can do some pretty funky stuff with the naming conventions in the view. For example: if you do this in the view:      <br /><font face="Courier">Html.TextBox(&quot;Product.Name&quot;, Model.Product.Name)</font> will       <br />and then call UpdateModel(), the Product-property will get new-ed and the Name-value set. </li> </ul>  <p>My goal with this session was to continue the use of the IsValid/GetRuleViolations-pattern from <a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2009/03/sprint-planner-helper-session-22.html">Session 22</a>. </p>  <p>But that broke down pretty fast – and I got to learn this pattern instead. I’ll take that any day! Much better knowledge. But I’ll get back to it – shortly. </p>  <p><strong>[UPDATED]     <br /></strong>I managed to nail the ValidationSummary-stuff… Here is a picture of it:</p>  <p><a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TI0jeIedRFk/Sc3859hkEgI/AAAAAAAAAD0/zuSO8bunTxU/s1600-h/ruleviolations%5B2%5D.jpg"><img title="ruleviolations" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-left: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-bottom: 0px" height="244" alt="ruleviolations" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TI0jeIedRFk/Sc386snnzWI/AAAAAAAAAD4/toypsj9vSI4/ruleviolations_thumb.jpg?imgmax=800" width="193" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>I have also pondered over me spending to much time in the MVC-trenches. If I re-read my <a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2009/01/what-to-do-now-sprint-planner-helper.html">initial intentions</a> this is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design" target="_blank">DDD</a>-learning project (as well as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development" target="_blank">TDD</a> and <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/" target="_blank">ASP.NET MVC</a>). But I feel that the DDD-ing has been sidestepped for a while. </p>  <p>I guess that it has to do with that the ASP.NET MVC is a framework that you need to learn how to get your way around. These thing takes time and can stop you in your tracks.</p>  <p>DDD on the other hand is a bunch of design patterns and a mindset – that can take considerable time to master but is often quite easy to get up and running with.&#160; </p>  <p>I’ll try to get back to the DDD-part of this in next session. I had to leave to test that doesn’t work so I’ll have to fix that first. but then…</p>
