Today, I want to highlight a [Kanban example](http://tinyurl.com/kanbanexample) shared by [Henrik Kniberg](http://blog.crisp.se/henrikkniberg). 

Henrik's insights into Kanban and agile practices have been incredibly influential. He was a major inspiration for my initial dive into Scrum and agile methodologies through his remarkable work, [Scrum from the Trenches](http://www.crisp.se/henrik.kniberg/ScrumAndXpFromTheTrenches.pdf). 

Check out his Kanban example for valuable perspectives and practical advice.
