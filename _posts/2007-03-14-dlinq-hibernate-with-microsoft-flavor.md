I have read somethings about the
[LINQ-project](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/aa904594.aspx)
at Microsoft. I haven't fully understood it yet but from [this
video](http://download.microsoft.com/download/4/7/0/4703eba2-78c4-4b09-8912-69f6c38d3a56/dlinq.wmv)
i see that it's really cool.

Also - as i understand it - this could be a way to build Hibernate-like
functionality with Microsoft products... for anyone who like that ;)
