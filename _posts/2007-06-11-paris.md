I've
been away on a short trip to Paris for a few days. It was my <span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_0"
class="blsp-spelling-corrected">surprise</span>-birthday-present to
<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-error">Elin</span>. She
was really <span>="blsp-spelling-corrected">surprised</span> also - i went to her
workplace and played (of course) "our song" on my euphonium. I guess
that it wasn't too good since two people guessed that it was the fire
alarm. This is, by far, the worst <span>="blsp-spelling-corrected">criticism</span> i ever have gotten
:).

Then we went to Paris and saw all the great things there; <span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_4" class="blsp-spelling-error">Sacre</span> <span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_5" class="blsp-spelling-error">Couer</span>, Eiffel
Tower (yes - we went up. No - walked the first two levels, then
elevator), <span>="blsp-spelling-error">L'arc</span> <span>="blsp-spelling-error">Triumpic</span> and Paris town in general.
It really is a nice town. I've been there before and didn't like it too
much but now it was great.

The hotel we stayed in was not to great (<span>="blsp-spelling-error">Altona</span> - don't go there) and was run
by two brothers that each of them was a Basil from <span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_9" class="blsp-spelling-error">Fawlty</span> Towers
on their own.

All in all a great trip. I'll add some photos later on.
