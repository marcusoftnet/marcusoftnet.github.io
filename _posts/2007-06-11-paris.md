I've
been away on a short trip to Paris for a few days. It was my <span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_0"
class="blsp-spelling-corrected">surprise-birthday-present to
Elin. She
was really surprised also - i went to her
workplace and played (of course) "our song" on my euphonium. I guess
that it wasn't too good since two people guessed that it was the fire
alarm. This is, by far, the worst criticism i ever have gotten
:).

Then we went to Paris and saw all the great things there; Sacre Couer, Eiffel
Tower (yes - we went up. No - walked the first two levels, then
elevator), L'arc Triumpic and Paris town in general.
It really is a nice town. I've been there before and didn't like it too
much but now it was great.

The hotel we stayed in was not to great (Altona - don't go there) and was run
by two brothers that each of them was a Basil from Fawlty Towers
on their own.

All in all a great trip. I'll add some photos later on.
