After some consideration, I have decided to follow the [ASP.NET MVC](http://www.asp.net/mvc/) best practices quite closely – and do the listing of the products as a separate page, the Index method on the Product Controller.

I’ll focus on this before the actual adding is fleshed out. This is because the Create method of the ProductController does a redirect to the Index action.

Also, I will keep the GUI very simple. If I do the [MVC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller) right, it will be easy for anyone who knows this.

[Wait one hour – Marcus is coding :)]

I actually got a product added today! And the more I work with TDD, DDD, and ASP.NET MVC, the more right it feels. [Read this](https://www.marcusoft.net/2009/02/why-ddd-rocks-marcusoftnet-version.html) and you’ll see what I mean.

I will have to create a factory for products… but my hour is up.
