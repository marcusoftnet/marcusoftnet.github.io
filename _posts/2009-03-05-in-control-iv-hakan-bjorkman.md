OK – here is one of the nicest and probably best trombone players in the world showing off his amazing technique.

Follow [this link](http://svtplay.se/v/1455978/musikministeriet/sex_musiker_tavlar_i_snabbhet) to a short clip from [SVT](http://www.svt.se) where a couple of musicians compete in playing the [Flight of the Bumble Bee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_of_the_Bumblebee). In Swedish... The whole program can be found [here](http://svtplay.se/v/1456709/musikministeriet/del_7_av_8?cb,a1364145,1,f,102880/pb,a1364142,1,f,102880/pl,v,,1456709/sb,p102880,1,f,-1).

Amazingly, Håkan plays the piece 20 beats faster than, for example, the violinist... And very clean.

Thanks for the lesson Håkan!
