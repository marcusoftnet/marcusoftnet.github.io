[](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kkDJOSPNTLs/RfphQi9JkEI/AAAAAAAAAGY/IPQp1IQJ0CI/s1600-h/IMAGE_002.jpg)Today
we're kicking off a new subproject at my customer. And except four new
features the customer has ask for only one (1) bug to be fixed. I don't
think that this will hold.

So.... i am saying the magical words; "if this release on contains that
one bug-fix i will eat my USB-mouse"
