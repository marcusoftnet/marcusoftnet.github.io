<div>

Here in Indonesia most companies and organizations have some kind of
uniform or at least very strict dress code. For example where I work,
the Salvation Army, we have Salvation Army uniform on Mondays and
Tuesdays, a set batik shirt on Wednesdays, "pick your own batik" on
Thursdays and training clothes on Fridays.

Here's a collage for you ~~to feast your eyes on~~ be scared by; showing
some of those shirts:

I must say... most of these shirts I've found really silly and ugly. The
don't sit right on me. I feel awkward.

Let me show you another uniform:

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

<a

data-border="0" width="400" height="222" /></a>

</div>

What kind of circus-uniforms am I looking at?! I would never put that
on. I'd feel like a magician from the 60-ies.

Finally let show you a picture:

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

</div>

Eeeh, crappy written ... arabic? Well first I haven't got a clue what it
says. Or means. Secondly... please can we color within the lines.

### Values

<div>

In my evaluations above I left out one things; **the values behind the
images**. Because they are filled with values. Stories and history that
fills these things with value. But only for those that know them.

</div>

<div>

<div style="text-align: left;">

data-border="0" width="120" height="200" /></a>My batik shirts are
traditional Jawanese clothing, worn by the people of Jawa for centuries.
On Wednesdays we wear the local batik from the area around Bandung,
where we work.

</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">

I had this shirt on when we were fighting a company that was on the
verge of collapsing.

</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">

I remember having it on when I held my first ever motivational speech to
the staff, and that they came up and kissed me (on the cheek, guys...)
afterwards. Because no one had motivated them in years. Just told them
that they didn't measure up to what others expected of them.  That was
an awesome feeling. I had that shirt on then.

data-border="0" width="150" height="200" /></a>The white shirt is the
Salvation Army uniform, this particular version is worn by Salvationists
in Indonesia - one of the biggest Salvation Army territories (countries)
of the world. It's called safari because we usually wear it when we are
doing not very official work.

</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">

This shirt is worn by Indonesian Salvation Army people around the
country everyday as they work in our remote located clinics, at our
hospitals, in our churches or in our children's homes.

</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">

I have worn that shirt cleaning up a disaster in one of our hospitals. I
had dirt all over it and water up to half my leg from time to time. It
took 3 days and we worked like crazy.

</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">

I had it on last Sunday when I played an
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphonium"
target="_blank">euphonium</a> at a church that celebrated their 100
years in service here in Indonesia.

data-border="0" width="320" height="177" /></a>The band uniform I showed
you is worn by the members of the
<a href="http://blackdykeband.co.uk/" target="_blank">Black Dyke
Band</a>. Not only one of the oldest (160 years ca) brass band in the
world but throughout that period also considered the best in the world.
Throughout that entire period.

</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">

Every single person that worn that uniform, throughout the years, has
been a master bandsman that given their best for the band.

</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">

Being a member of the band requires total dedication; rehearsals two
times a week and 5-10 concerts per month. Every single time they play
they are expected to excel. And they all have other jobs - being part of
Black Dyke is on their spare time.

</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">

I wouldn't dream of wearing that jacket. It would definitely be one of
the highlights of my life if I could just try one on.

</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">

I still remember the first time I saw the band (and their uniforms)
live. Amazing performance that changed my playing life for ever. What an
amazing band! Those uniforms always make me think about what the band
stands for.

data-border="0" width="200" height="200" /></a>The final picture is
actually Arabic (or at least a dialect of it). It means "Nasare" and is
used to mark Christian people and their houses, business, cars etc by IS
in their current effort to exterminate Christians.

</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">

Basically, for things and people branded with this the sign laws doesn't
apply. Its allowed to abuse, destroy, rape and even kill such people and
property without getting punished.

</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">

We have seen horrible scenes of beheaded humans, even children and total
destructions of home. People fleeing for their lives.

</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">

If you remember the David star that Nazis put on Jews during the
1930-1940-ies you're not far off from what this symbol means to
Christians in Iraq today.

</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">
</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">

I wear this symbol as my
<a href="http://twitter.com/marcusoftnet" target="_blank">Twitter</a>
and Facebook avatars right now. To show some kind of small support and
participation. To spread the information about these horrors. To remind
myself that not everyone that believes what I believe can do that
unpunished.  But I can. And that's a privilege.

</div>

### Value words

<div>

Every single company I have worked for have had **value words**. Big,
bold words that encourage us.
<a href="http://www.in.capgemini.com/about/group/values-ethics"
target="_blank">"Honesty, Boldness, Trust, Freedom, Team spirit,
Modesty"</a>, <a href="http://avegagroup.se/sv/Om-Avega-Group/Vara-varderingar/"
target="_blank">"Powerful, humane and professional"</a> and <a href="http://aptitud.se/" target="_blank">"Fighting spirit, Happiness
and transparency"</a>.

</div>

<div>

My clumsy translations to English is some cases.

</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>

All of those are great. Inspiring. Lifts my spirit.

</div>

<div>

But they don't mean anything without the story. Tell me the story behind
them. Write them in my heart so to speak.

</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>

How is this lived out in your company? Tell me the story behind Fighting
Spirit. When did someone last exhibit transparency? What happened? Why
did you put it in there in the first place?

</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>

The true value of our value words, symbols and yes, even uniforms, are
only revealed to sharing. Sharing moments, stories, history.

</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>

Then these symbols mean something. Be filled with value and we can
proudly stand up for them. Until then it's just empty words. Dead
fabric. Unreadable symbols.

</div>

<div>
</div>

> Don't only have value words. Fill the words with value. Fill them with
> your stories. And then they will truly become valuable words and not
> only value words.

<div>
