I have a couple of slow weeks before my next assignment starts for real, so as an early Christmas gift <a href="http://www.aptitud.se/" target="_blank">Aptitud</a> and I thought that we could give away some presentations for free.

Please contact me on marcusoftnet at gmail or <a href="http://www.twitter.com/marcusoftnet" target="_blank">@marcusoftnet</a> if you are interested in hearing any of the presentations below. No charge (saved any travel costs outside Stockholm... and the obligatory cup of strong, black coffee) and no strings attached.

**[UPDATED]** I have now booked my calendar to a suitable level (almost full). The response on this post was just overwhelming and I got 7 different gigs including a whole day at one company and a contact in Brasil (!). Might do this again. Longing to be bored again.

These are the presentations that I can give with an hours notice:

| Subject | Description | Level | Duration |
|:--- |:--- | :--- | :--- |
| A practical introduction to Kanban | This presentation will give you introduction to Kanban and how to get the most out of it. Throughout the presentation you will see a lot of situations and suggestions for how to handle the. There is a short introduction to Lean in there too. | Introduction  | 1 or 3 h versions available |
| Introduction to agile | In this presentation I present the reasons for doing agile (or lean) software development in the first place. What will I gain from that? What are the pitfalls introducing it? How can I get started in my organization | Introduction | 2 hours |
| Specification by example | Specification by example is the missing step for most development teams. It will help you to communicate better with your business stakeholders making sure that you build the right thing.<br /> As a interesting and rewarding side effect you can get regression tests for free. Oh yeah - and a documentation that is always up-to-date.  | Intro/ Intermediate | 2 hours |
| Specification by example with SpecFlow | Specification by example (or BDD if you like) is not about technology - it's about communication.<br /> This presentation however is all about the technology. I'll show you some common tools and also some coding techniques that will help you avoid problems in keeping your test-code working as the system grow | Intermediate/Advanced  | 3 hours |
| Get started with test driven development (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development" target="_blank">TDD</a>) | This talk introduces you and your team to test-driven development - a design and coding technique that helps you write deliberate and focused code. You'll get some tests for free.<br /> This is a technical talk that will include an interactive coding session. The coding will be done in C# if nothing else is preferred.  | Intermediate | 3 hours |
| Clean Code / SOLID | In order to move fast you need to move securely. To do that you have to write your code in a maintainable way. Robert C Martin aka Uncle Bob has taught us about Clean Code and the SOLID principles and in this talk I'll introduce you to them. | Introduction | 2-3 hours |
 | User stories - how to get the most out of them | User stories is the de facto standard to handle requirements in agile projects. But what are they really? And how do I do estimation with them? Or planning for that matter? Is there any special tricks or pitfalls that I should know of?<br /> In this presentation I'll share my experience with working with user stories - good and bad.  | Introduction | 2-3 hours |

I would love to come and talk to you on these subjects. Make it a happening over lunch or an afternoon of learning.
