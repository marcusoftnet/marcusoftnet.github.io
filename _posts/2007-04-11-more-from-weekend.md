Here are some more pictures from the beautiful [Hypplen](http://www.hitta.se/SearchCombi.aspx?SearchType=4&UCSB%3aWflWhite=1a1b&UCSB%3aWflPink=4a&UCSB%3aTextBoxWho=&UCSB%3aTextBoxWhere=hyppeln) (the place is nicer than it sounds, i promise).

It was surely a good weekend with a lot of winding down. Also my family are all very nice, which is so good when you get away like this. It's all very easy-going. Even though some of them get quite nasty when it comes to games, especially Fia-med-knuff. :)
