I've
been looking for a long time for a tool that watches the builds of TFS
for me, something that CruiseControl.NET does in a nice way.

Now i found it - in a nice working version -
[here.](http://www.zimms.com/downloads/BuildTicker.zip)

It is open source so you probably need to compile it before it runs. I
am also not sure if it starts up automatically or if you have to add it
to Autostart maybe.

However it looks nice and does the job to great satisfaction. Those
green blobs are really gratifying.
