Got a tip from [Joakim Sundén](http://www.joakimsunden.com/) about an article that introduces Kanban in a great way. [Here you are](http://agileproductdesign.com/blog/2009/kanban_over_simplified.html).

I don’t know if I understood it better this time because I [already knew about Kanban](https://www.marcusoft.net/2009/09/kanban-great-agile-tool.html), but it really resonated with me in a practical way after reading this.

I also loved some details in the presentation—just check the “Your estimated waiting time” boxes in this picture:

Thank you, Jeff.
