My situation right now is quite strange for me. The project I am
involved in at work is really running full speed ahead - with my largest
Scrum-team so far, 9 people - and at the same time I have some days a
week off.

This has to do with a great Swedish invention called parenthood leave
(my translation). When you think about it, it's actually quite amazing -
I get a lot of days from the government to be with my child. Sweden is
fantastic.

The hard part for me is to switch on and off since I am not a work a day
a week (or so) I still have my mind on ODP.NET, WCF and Aspects. But
hey - I might learn.

Today me and Abbe have been on a really long walk around some beautiful
archipelago right in the [middle of
Stockholm](http://www.hitta.se/ViewDetailsPlace.aspx?var=fredh%E4ll&SearchType=4&z=3&mapMode=map&toolbars=zoom%2Cbanner%2Ccontrols%2C&streetnumberid=100415669).
That was great! And more of those days are coming. I'll be sure to bring
my camera for the subsequent "tours".
