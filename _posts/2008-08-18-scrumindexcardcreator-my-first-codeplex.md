After reading about some great stuff that other people has published I
decided to take the leap and publish my first project. The one I decided
on was a small utility that I have had great use
of - the [Scrum Index Card
Creator](http://www.codeplex.com/ScrumIndexCard).

You can read about, and contribute to, the project and the application
here <http://www.codeplex.com/ScrumIndexCard>.

So... this [Scrum Index Card
Creator](http://www.codeplex.com/ScrumIndexCard) is the first official
release from [Marcusoft](http://www.marcusoft.net/).
I wonder where is might end...
