I was very fortunate to go to OreDev this year. It's just a great show - I described it as a "free bar of knowledge alcohol for learn-o-holics".<br />I thought I'll take a few moments just to jot down some highlights and stuff I picked up during my first day at <a href="http://www.oredev.org/" target="_blank">OreDev 2011</a>. This is mostly for me... but you can read it if you want.<br /><a name='more'></a><h3> Jon Skeet on Async in .NET 4.0</h3><div>I was late to the conference and missed the keynote, that I learned was awesome, and also late to this talk. Jon Skeet on the asynchronous features of .NET 4.0. I picked up some stuff though - most noteable I'll check out the <a href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/jon_skeet/archive/tags/Eduasync/default.aspx" target="_blank">EduAsync</a>&nbsp;blog posts and code that shows of all interesting features.&nbsp;</div><h3>  Aslam Kahn on Functional programming</h3><div>From this great session I picked up how Alsam had learned functional programming and how that changed how he thought about functional programming; building from simple structures and doing simple transformations on them, to finally abstract concepts on top of that.&nbsp;</div><div>Stop think about interactions between objects and start thinking of values of data and transformations on those data instead. Keep it immutable and return something from every function.</div><div>That doesn't come out right here but was great.&nbsp;</div><div><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/aslamkhn/not-quite-object-oriented" target="_blank">His slides is here</a>.</div><h3>  Sebastian Lambla on Restful API</h3><div>This was a great presentation. Loads of fun and a real practical introduction to REST. Thought me to:</div><div><ul><li>Send links back to the client so they now WHERE to go next; Link: ; rel="next"</li><li>Send back an empty form so the client knows WHAT to send back</li><li>Don't version - but break if data is needed. If not needed use optional values</li><li>Send control data in the form so that the client knows HOW to send additional requests</li></ul><div>All this will reduce coupling between the client and the server.&nbsp;</div></div><h3>  Phil Haack on Mobile in ASP.NET 4</h3><div>Phil struggled with the technology for the presentation but still showed some nice features and ways to make you web application be more mobile friendly.&nbsp;</div><div>I'll sure check out <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/" target="_blank">JQueryMobile</a> that looks awesome&nbsp;</div><h3> Christian Johansen on TDD and JavaScript</h3><div>This was another great session on how to do TDD in JavaScript. Amusing fact was that 100% of the people in the audience did TDD. 0% (!) of us did it in JavaScript.&nbsp;</div><div>Christian had some mean skills and the flow of the session was great. I'll check out JsTestDriver and maybe even check out his book.</div><h3> Felix Geisendörfer on Node.js</h3><div>And finally I went to learn some more about <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>. I think it sound very cool and I was blown away; this is huge (#2 watched project on GitHub, 230 contributors).</div><div>And the performance was equally impressive due to that everything in Node.js is what's called a "Non-blocking call" or&nbsp;asynchronously if you want.&nbsp;</div><div>And then my day came to a full circle with async again. &nbsp;</div>
