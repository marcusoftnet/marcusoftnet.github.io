This is just a short one. I don't know where I picked the thought up, probably from [David Marquet](http://www.davidmarquet.com/) or [Simon Sinek](https://www.startwithwhy.com/).

But really I'm so tired about talking about management for organisation and teams. Manage. That's what I do with computer resources, stuff and sheeps.

I have higher thoughts for just about every person I ever met. If something these people need a leader. Someone that points, with clarity, [towards the better future we are trying to reach](http://www.marcusoft.net/2014/10/vision-statements.html), creates an environment [where I can feel safe](http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_why_good_leaders_make_you_feel_safe) and [give room and be challenged to be the best I can be](https://twitter.com/woodyzuill/status/494416680622108672).

I much rather talk about leadership and leading than management and managing. Leadership is what you use on people, management is for your pens or harddisks.
