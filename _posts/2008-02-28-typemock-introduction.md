I my
next project (which is mega-cool, I'll get back) I will start using TDD
from the outset, which seems to be the only way to get it to work. To do
that we'll need a mocking framework and the flavor of the month seems to
be [TypeMock](http://www.typemock.com/).

There are not many very good introductions on the net but here are some
that are the best so far:

- Unit test patterns, [part
  I](http://www.typemock.com/Docs/TestPatterns.html),
  [II](http://www.typemock.com/Docs/Mock%20Types.html) and
  [III](http://www.typemock.com/Docs/NaturalTypeMocks.html)
- Some [examples and how-tos](http://www.typemock.com/Docs/HowTo.html)
  that also seems to be good

PS
Following a really fast answer (ca 4 hours after my posting) from the
TypeMock-team (this Internet thingy is so cool, isn't it) I want to add
two movies:
