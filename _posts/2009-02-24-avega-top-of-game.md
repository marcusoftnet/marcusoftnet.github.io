[Avega](http://www.avegagroup.se) has the best consultants in Sweden! We of course knew that already, but now it's proven since the Avega team won the [Swedish Championships in Business Value](http://www.agical.se/geeknight_awards.html). [More here](http://computersweden.idg.se/2.2683/1.211782/sm-i-affarsnytta). [And here](http://computersweden.idg.se/2.2683/1.214199/har-ar-sverigemastarna-i-affarsnytta?utm_source=webb&utm_medium=senaste_box).

The Avega team [shattered the competition](http://blog.avegagroup.se/JoakimSunden/archive/2009/02/23/sm-i-affarsnytta-vi-vann.aspx) with 1365 points (about 1200 points ahead of the second place!!!).

Great work, guys! We are very proud of you. And I am humbled to be a part of the Avega team. We rock!

So – if you want to work with the best, [you’ll know where to find us](http://avegagroup.se/Arbeta-hos-Avega/)!
