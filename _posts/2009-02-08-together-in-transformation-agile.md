Today I did a presentation for the Salvation Army at a Hearing day that our Territorial Commander, Victor Poke has assembled. I was a bit confused at first but then I felt quite at easy with the whole thing since my topic suited me perfect. It was Together in Transformation.

Of course I couldn’t resist to preach the Agile gospel even for the Salvation Army. We are often quite rigid in our structures so that could be needed from time to time.

It was well received with a very rewarding discussion afterwards. It also felt very good for me to be able to put some quotes form the bible on a PowerPoint slide. Haven’t done that before.
