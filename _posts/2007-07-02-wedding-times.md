Again - the Swedish summer proved to be a very good choice for
marriage. A week and a year after Elin and I got married, Elins younger
sister did the same. Her husband (now-a-days ;)) is a very nice guy and
they were a splendid couple.

Also it again made me realize how happy i can be that have such nice
relatives and the once "added" to the family is equal nice and good to
be with. I really enjoy spending time with them.

When that is said; the weekend was quite hectic involving me driving
back-and-forth Vallentuna and Stockholm (3 Swedish
miles one way) more times than i care to remember. Also the weekend was
topped of with playing at the Salvation Army Congress here in Sweden. It
was quite fun also, but i was so tired...
