Again - the Swedish summer proved to be a very good choice for
marriage. A week and a year after <span>="blsp-spelling-error">Elin</span> and I got married, <span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-error">Elins</span> younger
sister did the same. Her husband (now-a-days ;)) is a very nice guy and
they were a splendid couple.

Also it again made me realize how happy i can be that have such nice
relatives and the once "added" to the family is equal nice and good to
be with. I really enjoy spending time with them.

When that is said; the weekend was quite <span>="blsp-spelling-corrected">hectic</span> involving me driving
back-and-forth <span>="blsp-spelling-error">Vallentuna</span> and Stockholm (3 <span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_4" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Swedish</span>
miles one way) more times than i care to <span>="blsp-spelling-corrected">remember</span>. Also the weekend was
topped of with playing at the Salvation Army Congress here in Sweden. It
was quite fun also, but i was so tired...
