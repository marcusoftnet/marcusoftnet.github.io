<p>As readers of this blog might have noticed I have not only switched to Mac (Book Pro) but also have done so after a long while on the PC-side of things. </p>  <p>I am not sure that it has anything to do with this but the wonderful <a href="http://www.pestaola.gr/img3/macbook-pro-multi-touch-glass-trackpad.jpg" target="_blank">touch pad</a> on my Mac Book and I don’t click (no pun intended). I may also have to do with lacking fine motorics…&#160; but I hope not.</p>  <p>One of my most trusted Mac-source have supplied me with this video. Thanks Magnus.</p>  <p><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/_VeAOK8Rxoo&amp;hl=sv&amp;fs=1&amp;"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/_VeAOK8Rxoo&amp;hl=sv&amp;fs=1&amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object></p>
