First, admit that the title alone is very tempting… You want it, you
need it… but how to get it?

How do you manage the steady flow of mail and requests during a day? How
do you stay afloat? That’s what you can learn from picking up on the
inbox zero concept.

I first learned about this concept at a <a
href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2009/11/oredev-day-5-keynote-and-morning.html"
target="_blank">presentation by Scott Hanselmann at ÖreDev</a>. You can
see this <a
href="http://www.oredev.org/prod/oredev/site.nsf/docsbycodename/session?opendocument&amp;sid=F5513DE6A2AF7BE9C1257598006BB18F&amp;track=71EDB5B62F6F88A2C12575A500499802&amp;day=5"
target="_blank">presentation here</a>.
<a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/" target="_blank">Mr
Hanselmann</a> has <a
href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/TheThreeMostImportantOutlookRulesForProcessingMail.aspx"
target="_blank">put out some other advices</a> that are well worth
reading as well.

I then realized that the concept is older than that presentation and was
invented by
<a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/" target="_blank">Merlin Mann</a>. He
even has a site on the subject;
<a href="http://www.inboxzero.com" target="_blank">InboxZero.com</a>.
But he looks so crazy on that video that I didn’t dare watch it ;)

Here is a great presentation Merlin Mann did at Google. It will take you
through the basic rules and improve your mail management – I promise.
Spend 58:38 minutes and save years of boring mail reading:
