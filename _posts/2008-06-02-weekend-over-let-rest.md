This weekend was one of the hectic I've been through in a long time. But
in retrospective also one of the most exciting and rewarding.

Going backwards;

-   Yesterday night we played a musical service at the <a
    href="http://www.hitta.se/ViewDetailsPlace.aspx?vad=&amp;var=%f6stermalmsgatan+69&amp;StreetNumberId=100385670"
    target="_blank">Temple</a> in Stockholm. Quite a good turnout with
    people - and many of the performances were the best during the
    complete rehearsal period.
-   Before that - photo session with the Vasa Band for our CD -
    Priority. That was very fun and I hope and think that the pictures
    will be nice
-   During the afternoon we went to <a

    target="_blank">Abbes</a> first children birthday party. Viola
    turned 1 year!
-   The Sunday started with our prayer group being in charge of the
    Sunday morning meeting. Abbes has got a small cold so I wasn't
    present for the whole meeting but it felt alright until I left.
-   The Saturday was entirely devoted for the Stockholm Marathon. As <a

    target="_blank">I wrote earlier</a> the Salvation Army of Sweden was
    human-sponsor for this event and did a collection for water tanks in
    schools in Kenya. This was big success (haven't heard anything about
    the amount yet) with loads and loads of people listening to us and
    helping us in our cause.
   During the day several Salvationist were running to promote the
    charity and best of them were <a

    target="_blank">Martin Musembe</a> who ended up as <a
    href="http://www.sr.se/Radiosporten/nyheter/artikel.asp?artikel=2106792"
    target="_blank">#8</a> - very impressive.
   For me the day started off horrendously with large amount of stress
    for leaving my uniform and other stuff all over town! Also I was
    quite tired after "rocking the boat" at <a
    href="http://hitta.se/ViewDetailsPlace.aspx?vad=&amp;var=Odenplan&amp;PlaceId=2471632"
    target="_blank">Odenplan</a> for six and half hours straight...
    In the end these were small matters - it was a great day!
