I have been talking about
<a href="http://www.kanban101.com" target="_blank">Kanban</a> a lot the
last couple of years. Sometimes to the point where I think that I must
have talked a hole in the head of the those closest to me. But from time
to time you get great response, for example;

Anna (an
<a href="http://www.avegagroup.se" target="_blank">Avega Group</a>
colleague) attended one of my Kanban introductions and became inspired.
She started to implement parts of the practices I’ve suggested at her
client and soon ran into some questions. She sent me an email and asked
for my suggestions on how to act in certain situations.

I of course answered but also felt the questions was not only good, they
were also common. So I thought that I’ll share my suggestions here. Bear
in mind, as I also told Anna, that Kanban is really just a couple of
simple rules – how you apply them in your context is very much up to
you. This has led to a plethora of practices and ways to solve problems.
These are the ones I have picked up in the great network I have
surrounded myself with.

So important to note is that Kanban as methodology doesn’t answer any of
these questions. It’s up to you.

### How do you highlight new activities on the board?

Anna also said; we don’t want them to get mixed up with the ones we
already have there. I suspect that she was talking about the work items
that might get prioritized over already committed work.

Actually this is one of the benefits of using a flow approach such as
Kanban. It’s gives you control and power to say Yes! Yes to change
prioritization in the middle of the flow. Yes to add new stuff in your
queue of items. I know that
<a href="http://agilemanagement.net/" target="_blank">David J
Andersson</a> consider that as title for his
<a href="http://agilemanagement.net/index.php/kanbanbook/"
target="_blank">Kanban book</a>; Kanban – how to become a Yes man!

When you have control over a visualized flow it’s easy to see what can
be added and what then need to be removed.

One way to handle that is to let the stakeholder have complete control
over the Inbox. In my current assignment our project manager is allowed
6 items in our To-do-column. How he prioritizes them is up to him. We
simply know that the top one is the first we should work on.

If you feel that, that would make your flow too unpredictable you could
allow for a fixed number of items that they cannot change the order on.
But what they do before your inbox is completely up to them.

### Is it ok to add work items whenever – or only during daily standup?

In my opinion you should at least talk to some other person in the team
when adding or changing the order your work items. It doesn’t have to be
a formal meeting but could. I’ve experienced anything from big
prioritization meetings with several participants (see below) to just
letting the stakeholder add notes when the feel like.

One thing I’ve tried that force a communication to take place is that a
note must be estimated in size before added to the board. That make the
stakeholder talk and describe the item before adding it to the board.

When it comes to moving the board I encourage moving of the items when
the state of the work changes. Not just at daily standups. There’s some
people, mainly in the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(development)"
target="_blank">Scrum</a> community,  advocating moving of the work
items only at the daily standup. I was one of them. But then I realized
that the board should convey the status of the work – and it should be
up to date all the time. So I suggest you move the sticky when the state
of the work has changed. That’s also much easier to remember and gives
instant feedback of the progress made on the item.

### Do you have any suggestion for a simple, powerful agenda on a daily standup?

This one was actually easy. You simply “walk the board”, enumerating
work from the right to the left. This will emphasize the pull-principle
so that we see work have been pulled into new states, closer to the
goal.

Instead of asking all members of the team what their status is we
concentrate on the work being done.

If you are in a hurry or have a large team you can simply stop with any
deviations from normal. Anything blocked? Anyone not respecting
WIP-limits? Work items without attention? Missuse of the board? People
sitting on more than one notes? Items having stayed for a long time in
the same place?

Stuff that just flow as normal doesn’t need our attention right now.
Keeping to just the deviations has led to really big team (40+ people)
having daily standups in under 5 minutes.

Keep the meeting short (10 min max) and focus. Put off any discussion to
after the daily standup. What I’ve found is that pretty soon will small
groups gather after the daily standup and talk about the work. Or better
– the process and how to improve it.

### What’s a suitable range in size for work items?

It depends, said the consultant and sent his check… This is very hard to
give a general answer to, of course.

For small tasks I would say that if it takes longer time to manage the
sticky (creating it, adding it to the board and move it) than the work
itself – don’t add it to the board. But make a note of work being
accomplished. My good friend
<a href="http://joakimsunden.com" target="_blank">Joakim Sunden</a> as
written an <a
href="http://joakimsunden.com/2011/06/one-way-of-handling-small-tasks-on-a-kanban-board/"
target="_blank">excellent blog post</a> on this matter. I suggest you
check it out.

In the other end you have to consider what value you want from the
board. A board ~~is~~ should be an information radiator. If you have
work items sitting in the same state for several weeks it will not give
you any value. I usually have 1-2 week as maximum, estimated time
through the board.

Of course sometimes you have waiting stages (such as “Waiting for
deployment”) and then you can batch up many items there.

Even though I suggest that you try to slice up big work in to smaller
end-to-end slices of functionality and manage each separately, you could
also: split them into tasks and move the task. Here I’ve read about
people keeping a number series to keep track of when the main item can
be moved.

Say you have a big work item entering development.

You give it a number (5 – Allow for credit card payment).

You then add tasks for that item;

- 5.1. Update database,
- 5.2 Create GUI
- 5.3 Create business layer,
- 5.4 Integration with PayPal.
- etc.

As the team start work on the sub items they move them over to
Development done.

When the last item has move the whole work item can be moved (#5 that
is)

This pattern will help you to keep track of the status of the work even
for big items. Also by divide the work item into smaller tasks you have
to think hard about what is needed to complete the task. That is a
exercise well worth the time in itself. Hence I never allow for task
bigger than 8 h (1 day).

### How do you handle recurring activities, such as weekly meetings etc?

I usually don’t add these to the board. It’s not stuff that “make our
customer happy”. But of course if you want to track the how much time is
spent on meetings… then by all means add them.

In one team I’ve been in we had recurring activities (generating
customer invoices) that needed to be done by certain dates in the month.
So they created stickies that they reused for those activities and kept
them in a corner of the board. With the next due date written above
them. When that date approached we simply move the item to the top of
the Inbox.

### We have several stakeholders that supply us with work – how do you make them prioritize among themselves?

This sounds exactly like the situation where the first Kanban system was
ever created in software development. It’s described in great detail in
<a href="http://agilemanagement.net/index.php/kanbanbook/"
target="_blank">David J Anderssons Kanban book</a>. Simplified they had
a maintenance team (in India) that got their work from 4 different
managers. Of course all of these wanted “their” items to be prioritized
over the other work.

The manager of the team solved this by send them an email when the team
had room for 3 new items. They then decided among each other what to
prioritize now. Pretty soon the mail was automated. And also the
stakeholders started to deal among each other (if I vote for your item
this now can I count on your support later?).

The reason, I think, that this worked has to visibility and building
trust by delivering value often. The stakeholders knew, roughly, how
long it would take until the opportunity to add item. So if they missed
out this time it wouldn’t be long until the next occasion. The didn’t
have to wait so long until the next train, if you like.

It’s of course better to meet in person if you can. But invite all your
stakeholders. Describe how your process works and how they can see work
flow through the process. Show them how you will deliver faster (maybe
even promise a max time?) if you can work with fewer items running at
the same time.

### Conclusion

I hope you could make sense of this even though the questions were out
of context. I would love some comments on other ways to handle these
situations.
