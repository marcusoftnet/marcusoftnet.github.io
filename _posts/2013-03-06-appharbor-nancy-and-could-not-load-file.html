<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I've built a small application. Just something I threw together with a friend during a hack-session at the client. (It's a <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/DotVoting.html">dot voting</a> application and you can <a href="http://dotvoter.appharbor.com/">try it here</a>, if it's up :))<br /><br />As we wanted something out there fast we built it with <a href="http://www.nancyfx.org/">NancyFx</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a> (a first for me) and we host it on <a href="https://appharbor.com/">AppHarbor</a>&nbsp;with continuous delivery via <a href="http://support.appharbor.com/kb/getting-started/deploying-your-first-application-using-git">GitHub</a>. Since all of these (saved Mongo) has served me well in the past I was very surprised when we ran into problem.<br /><br /><a name='more'></a><br />When a commit is pushed to AppHarbor the application is compiled and the test (if any) are run. That worked fine for us but then a stage is run that's called "Site precompilation".<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-BD7_e-V8lx0/UTb-Sh747XI/AAAAAAAABbs/KZKlNXi6keQ/s1600/Screen+Shot+2013-03-06+at+09.28.37+.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="118" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-BD7_e-V8lx0/UTb-Sh747XI/AAAAAAAABbs/KZKlNXi6keQ/s320/Screen+Shot+2013-03-06+at+09.28.37+.png" width="320" /></a></div><br />That failed with the following error:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">error ASPCONFIG: Could not load file or assembly 'Nancy.ViewEngines.Razor.BuildProviders' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.</pre></blockquote>This had me for quite awhile when I got a tip on "disabling precompilation". In fact, the log tells me so also, at the very bottom:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;">Website precompilation failed with exit code 1. Precompilation can optionally<b> be disabled in application settings</b></pre></blockquote>The only thing was that I didn't understand the log. Hmmm ... haven't I been here before?<br /><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MerjpNT5euw/UTcbUy6hOLI/AAAAAAAABb8/iMgJ9Thm5Zc/s1600/Screen+Shot+2013-03-05+at+20.20.54+.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="84" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MerjpNT5euw/UTcbUy6hOLI/AAAAAAAABb8/iMgJ9Thm5Zc/s320/Screen+Shot+2013-03-05+at+20.20.54+.png" width="320" /></a>OK, cutting to the chase here. The last part of the log comes from&nbsp;<a href="https://appharbor.com/">AppHarbor</a>&nbsp; In fact the precompilation is a&nbsp;<a href="https://appharbor.com/">AppHarbor</a>&nbsp;thing that can be turned off.<br />Go to [your application]-&gt;Settings-&gt;Build and click the "Disable precompilation"-button. It's enabled by default.<br /><br />That made my application compile and being deployed. Where back on the <a href="http://elegantcode.com/2011/11/23/a-year-of-the-super-duper-happy-path/">SuperDuperHappyPath</a>.<br /><br />That problem cost us a lot of trial and error... and frustration. But now you don't have to experience the same thing.<br /><br /></div>
