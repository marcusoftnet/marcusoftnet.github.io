This weekend I was guest on a wedding. It was all very nice but it
struck me how hard it is to keep those kind of parties interesting for
everybody.

A quite natural focus is on two persons and if you don't know them (as i
didn't do - and as often is the case) it will tend to get quite hard to
follow.

Then there is the thing with the people around your table. A strange
tradition in Sweden is that you are placed with people you don't know.
And this only if you are married yourself - up to that point you are
seated with your girlfriend.

So that placed me next to the priests wife. She was quite nice but
talked soft and also dozed of into sleep from time to time. This is not
a very good grade for me I realize :). To my defense I can say that she
was about 75 and drank quite a lot during the evening...
