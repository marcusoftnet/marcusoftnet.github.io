<p>This became so much and was so good that I publish it as a separate post.</p>  <p>After pretty disappointing morning I’m hoping that <a href="http://www.dannorth.com" target="_blank">Dan North</a> will bring things back to great – as most of the day was yesterday.</p>  <p>Dan promised yesterday that he will bash on Scrum a lot in this talk… And at the same time as this there is a talk on Entity Framework 2.0. With <a href="http://www.ayende.com/" target="_blank">Ayende</a> and <a href="http://blog.scottbellware.com/" target="_blank">Scott Bellware</a> in the audience… </p>  <p>OK – our hall is filling up. Dan is smiling. Could be fun. Here are some quotes:</p>  <ul>   <li>A manager in a crappy system with a certificate is still a manager in a crappy system </li>    <li>Certified$crumMa$ter :) </li>    <li>Check out the <a href="http://www.stevenmsmith.com/my-articles/article/the-satir-change-model.html" target="_blank">Satir change model</a> to understand peoples reluctance to change </li>    <li>Think of the different stages of the <a href="http://blog.bruceabernethy.com/post/The-Dreyfus-Model-of-Skills-Acquisition.aspx" target="_blank">Dreyfus model</a> </li>    <li>“75% of <strong>uncoached</strong> Scrum projects will fail” – Ken Schweiber </li>    <li>Get a build/continuous integration! Because flushing out the problems around that process flesh out a lot of problems </li>    <li>Automate tests! Introduce assumptions test to test legacy code. Assumptions test is a way to document your assumptions on the legacy code. </li>    <li>Understand <a href="http://business-advice.vugg.net/search/Deliberate%20Discovery" target="_blank">Deliberate Discovery</a> around the domain, the architecture and the people. </li>    <li><a href="http://www.project-management-knowledge.com/definitions/r/rolling-wave-planning/" target="_blank">Rolling wave planning</a> – only break the imminent stories to details. </li>    <li>Get good a writing stories; break features into stories, have them concisely small and then each story size is 1 story. Here he made a reference to “A slackers guide on project tracking” </li>    <li>WaterScrum – your sprint are too long Which gets you all the downsides of both Agile and Waterfall… </li>    <li>Go to one week sprints. Identify what hurts and fix it! Plan –&gt; Do –&gt; Check –&gt; Act </li>    <li>“I love failing. Its fun and is a great opportunity to learn” </li>    <li>Spent money is spent (on investment in tooling/processes) – instead think of the impact on effectiveness. </li>    <li>Build trust with the business – demonstrate and celebrate success, demonstrate transparency </li>    <li>Remember to get the “What’s in it for me!” to all parts of your value chain; operations, test, business, corporate and developers. </li>    <li>Projects (and their management) will not pay for change… “Not on my budget!”. Solve this by getting the project management responsible for the system lifecycle and make small changes frequently </li>    <li>Introduce a strategic change pot of money that transcends projects </li>    <li>On architects in Ivory towers: “I don’t write code anymore – Don’t you see my long white beard?” :D </li>    <li>Get the architect into the teams as consultants. Reward them for sharing knowledge. </li>    <li>Stewart leadership – leadership by getting coffee. </li>    <li>Integrate tester into the team and invest in automated testing. </li>    <li>Systematic change requires systemically change </li>    <li>“A bad system will beat a good person every time.” – Edward Deming </li> </ul>  <p>I’ve run into many of these problems and thought hard on much of the solutions but this was so crisp and good. </p>
