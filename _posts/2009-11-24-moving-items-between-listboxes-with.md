A quick search led me to this helpful guide: [How to Add/Remove ListItems from One ListBox to Another Using jQuery](http://www.codedigest.com/CodeDigest/90-How-to-Add--Remove-ListItems-from-one-ListBox-to-Another-Using-JQuery-.aspx).

It answered my question in seconds. The internet is a fantastic resource, and Google is indispensable for a contractor like me.
