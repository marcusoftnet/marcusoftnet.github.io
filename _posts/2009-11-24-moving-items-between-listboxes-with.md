OK – this was so special and lucky… Being a newbie at
<a href="http://jquery.com/" target="_blank">JQuery</a> I was wondering
on how to move items between listboxes. Well a <a
href="http://www.google.se/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=jquery+moving+items+listbox"
target="_blank">quick search</a> later and this popped up:

Answering the question in two seconds. Internet is wonderful thing and
without Google I couldn’t function as a contractor.
