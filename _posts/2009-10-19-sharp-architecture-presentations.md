I came across a fantastic presentation on the [S#arp Architecture](http://www.sharparchitecture.net/) framework, delivered by [Billy McCafferty](http://devlicio.us/blogs/billy_mccafferty/), the creator of the framework.

The presentation is so compelling that it makes you want to dive right into coding with it. While it may feel a bit "rough" around the edges, I suspect we'll see significant improvements in the developer experience in the near future.

Additionally, tomorrow [HÃ¥kan Alexander](http://blog.avegagroup.se/HakanAlexander/) will be presenting the framework at [Elevate](http://blog.avegagroup.se/Elevate). It will be interesting to see how the Avegean community responds. I'm optimistic about a big success!
