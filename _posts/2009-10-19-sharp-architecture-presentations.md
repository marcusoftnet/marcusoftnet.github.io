Found a great presentation on the excellent
<a href="http://www.sharparchitecture.net/" target="_blank">S#arp
Architecture</a> framework. The presentation is given by
<a href="http://devlicio.us/blogs/billy_mccafferty/"
target="_blank">Billy McCafferty</a> who is the father of the framework.

It’s so good – you just want to start to code with it. It’s a bit
“rough” but I suspect that we will see some major improvements in the
“developer experience” in the near future.

Also – tomorrow <a href="http://blog.avegagroup.se/HakanAlexander/"
target="_blank">Håkan Alexander</a> will present the framework at
<a href="http://blog.avegagroup.se/Elevate" target="_blank">Elevate</a>.
It will be great to see how the framework will be received among the
Avegean. I would cast my vote on big success…
