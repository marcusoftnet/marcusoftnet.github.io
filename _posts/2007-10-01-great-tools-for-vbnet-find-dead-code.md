OK - as you all well know Microsoft doesn't put as much effort into
Visual Studio for VB.NET-developers as for C#-<span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">ditto. I
don't know why - but can only speculate that they don't won't that
language around in the long run. This is not sarcasm - it quite obvious
if you switch between the languages.

So someone
else has to help us - here are great bunch of tools that assist
the lonely VB.NET-developer in his struggles:

My favorite feature so far is the ability to find dead code - that is
code that isn't used. I have remove many rows of code this way... lot
less to maintain.
