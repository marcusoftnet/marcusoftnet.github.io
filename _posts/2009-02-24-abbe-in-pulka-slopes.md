Winter has “struck” Stockholm and we have lots of snow. And knowing the
Stockholm weather we expect most of it to be gone in a few days.

So we hurried out and bought Abbe his first pulka (kind of small sledge)
and went to the slopes of
<a href="http://www.hitta.se/LargeMap.aspx?var=Kronobergsparken"
target="_blank">Kronobergsparken</a>.

We thought that it was loads of fun. Elin and Abbe swished down the
slopes. I got a few runs myself (for my self also ;) and the memories
all came back. Running up the slope with the pulka in a string behind
you. Getting cold after the first run… Ahhh the memories.

Apparently Abbe was not as amused as we were.
