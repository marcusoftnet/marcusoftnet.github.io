Winter has “struck” Stockholm and we have lots of snow. And knowing the Stockholm weather, we expect most of it to be gone in a few days.

So we hurried out and bought Abbe his first pulka (kind of small sledge) and went to the slopes of [Kronobergsparken](http://www.hitta.se/LargeMap.aspx?var=Kronobergsparken).

We thought that it was loads of fun. Elin and Abbe swished down the slopes. I got a few runs myself (for myself also ;) and the memories all came back. Running up the slope with the pulka in a string behind you. Getting cold after the first run… Ahhh the memories.

Apparently, Abbe was not as amused as we were.
