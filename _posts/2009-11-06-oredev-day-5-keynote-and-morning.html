<h5>Information overload and managing flow</h5>  <p>The last day kicks off with a keynote given by <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/" target="_blank">Scott Hanselmann</a>, who is one of my &quot;heroes&quot; if you like. I always wanted to see him live, he is usually informative and really funny. Here is some off his tips on the subject:</p>  <ul>   <li>Effectiveness – doing the right things</li>    <li>Efficiency – doing the things right (jumping off a cliff in a efficient way :))</li>    <li>Triage – sort information. Don’t leave things in your inbox</li>    <li>Do it – drop it – delegate it – defer it = pick one.</li>    <li>Sort your data streams (twitter, email, colleague) into Signals and Noise</li>    <li>Email that you’re cc:ed on are not as important To:</li>    <li>Mailing list</li>    <li>Don’t check emails in the morning - “If you are the fastest responder to a problem, you will get all the problems.”</li>    <li>Check email three times a day – for 20 minutes each.</li>    <li>You cannot beat the system by putting in more hours.</li>    <li>Use the <a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2009/08/pomodoro-being-agile-and-focused-on.html" target="_blank">Pomodoro Technique</a> and schedule your work (emailing, phoning, blogging, coding etc.)</li>    <li>Audit your input and streamline it.</li>    <li>“You can’t cut if you don’t measure” – Scott Hanselmann</li>    <li>Tools</li>    <ul>     <li><a href="www.rescuetime.com/" target="_blank">Rescue Time</a> – introspective retrospectives</li>      <li><a href="http://www.43folders.com/" target="_blank">43 folders</a> looks quite messy but powerful</li>      <li>Sync to paper – check out <a title="http://pocketmod.com/" href="http://pocketmod.com/">http://pocketmod.com/</a></li>      <li>Write things down that you want to do during a week. And check that the list is done or not at the end of the week</li>      <li><a href="http://www.evernote.com/" target="_blank">Evernote</a></li>      <li><a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/" target="_blank">Remember the milk</a> instead of todo.txt</li>      <li>Use email rules as above (to:/cc: and calendar invites)</li>   </ul> </ul>  <p>This was very funny and informative. The funniest is that he did basically the same as the Zen-guru Marc Lesser. But oh so different… </p>  <h5>The Pair Programming Show</h5>  <p>This promise to be great. The first slide says “How to teach pair programming?” It looks to be, just as the title, as a show. With props and the whole thing – nice. The presentation is done by <a href="http://niclasnilsson.se/" target="_blank">Niclas Nilsson</a> and <a href="http://blog.crisp.se/hansbrattberg/" target="_blank">Hans Brattberg</a></p>  <p>Also they promise to show some of the bad things that we can experience when teaching/learning pair programming. </p>  <p>Pair programming is about; communication, learning and communication. So be patient, split time with keyboard equal, talk, not show. It’s hard! But the only way to get everybody up to speed.</p>  <p>Without an engaged navigator you don’t collaborate and share mind. Then you get any of the advantages of pair programming. A complicated operation is always performed with two doctors. Would you rather have one?</p>  <p>There are now giving some <a href="http://www.agitar.com/solutions/why_unit_testing.html" target="_blank">great points</a> on why pair programming is feasible and economical. For example <a href="http://www.agitar.com/images/defect_chart.gif" target="_blank">this chart</a>.</p>  <p>It’s easier to stand up for code quality and not “hacking” when you are two people together… Also it’s harder to hide technical debt.</p>  <p>They had an excellent summary slide of benefits with too much for me reloop here.</p>  <h5>Breaking out of dependency hell</h5>  <p>This talk is given by a tired <a href="http://www.ayende.com" target="_blank">Ayende</a>. He has promised to use his designated victim method… Better stay alert. </p>  <p>He talked about the use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection" target="_blank">Dependency Injection</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control" target="_blank">Inversion of Control containers</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration" target="_blank">Convention over configuration</a> to manage solution complexity.</p>  <p>Using a Inversion of Container will make us feel like you lose control of your dependencies. And that is the whole idea – if you micro-manage your dependencies will give you a static system that is hard to change (<a href="http://www.oodesign.com/open-close-principle.html" target="_blank">Open-Close-principle</a>, open for extension but closed for modification).</p>  <p>Another benefit from using an IoC is that you get opportunity to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming" target="_blank">aspect-oriented programming</a>, to handle cross cutting concerns.</p>
