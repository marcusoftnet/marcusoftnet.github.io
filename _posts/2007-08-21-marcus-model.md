OK - today was one of the strangest days in my working life - at least if you look on what I did...

[Avega](http://www.avega.se/) is doing a makeover of our website - which, if we are honest was needed for a while. On the site the want to show some of our consultant. Also they wanted to show their hobbies and activities from outside of work.

So I have been posing in my "working outfit" - that was quite a bit more formal than I usually have - and in the Salvation Army uniform and euphonium.

I pictures was actually quite nice, surprisingly with me on them... Nothing naked (as IF??) and just nice pictures. I post them and a link to the pictures on the Avega - site as they are released.

Also I found the whole experience quite nice - might strike up a new career here... or maybe not :)
