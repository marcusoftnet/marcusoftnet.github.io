OK,
the weekend is over (yes, prolonged i know) and my [list of scary
stuff](http://marcushammarberg.blogspot.com/2007/04/also-i-am-now-entering-one-of-more.html)
is now down to almost nothing. Which i take that i am not afraid of
nothing anymore - good!

On Sunday i was presenter on the last concert of <span

Brass Band. Sad - but i tried to keep the focus of that fact and keep
focus on the music instead. For me the concert also was a milestone
since the conductor was Nicholas <span>="blsp-spelling-error">Childs</span> - the musical director of
Black Dyke Band, brass band personality extraordinaire and one of my
childhood idols. I still have posters of him (and his brother Robert) on
my boy room wall.

The concert went well with a bit of awkward twist since an early flight
spoiled the order of the program. From what i heard in the audience that
didn't interfere much. The band was also in excellent form. Good to
hear!

Yesterday, Monday, was a sad day when the funeral of [Bengt <span>Eklund</span>](http://marcushammarberg.blogspot.com/2007/04/bengt-eklund.html)
took place. The service was very nice(?) and a lot of fitting and good
music was played. There was a lot of tears and sobbing though, and the
farewell from the band is a memory that will stay with me forever. Thank
you guys for letting me be a part of it.

Afterwards was a small get-together which in turn was a quite happy and
bright event. I really enjoyed hear all the people talk and laugh about
nice memories from Bengt.

So three big "thank you"-s are in order:

-   Bengt - thank you for your energy, inspiration and good mood. I now
    understand that it was all by love. I am so proud to have called you
    my friend. Thank you for everything Bengt.
-   Kerstin - thank you for trusting in me and for your confidence that
    i would pull it off. You made me strong and I hope that I could help
    you and your family in some way. Thank you
-   <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_3" class="blsp-spelling-error">GBB</span> -
    thanks for letting me into the band again and again. I feel like one
    of you and my thumbs are already white for you doing well at the
    <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_4"
    class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Europeans</span>.
