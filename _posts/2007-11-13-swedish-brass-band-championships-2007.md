As I [predicted](http://marcushammarberg.blogspot.com/2007/10/swedish-brass-band-championships-2007.html)
the Swedish Brass band championships this year was mostly a formal
matter when it comes the first places.

Windcorp of course took the top honors. They weren't treated really when
[Stockholms Brass](http://www.stockholmbrass.se/) band didn't show up.
That [Solna](http://www.solnabrass.com/) was second was not too
surprising either.

After that it was quite open and i congratulate [Malm√∂ Brass
band](http://www.malmobrassband.com/) with the third place. And that
[Torsby](http://www.torsbybrass.se/) was fourth was a real feat - well
done [Torsby](http://www.torsbybrass.se/) and Berit Palmquist!

BK was a bit of a disappointment since they usually play very well. I
had them as third in my prediction.

So there you have it - lets hope that Stockholm Brass band hangs in
there for another year so that the competition will get exciting again.
Windcorp right now is miles ahead of the rest of the field and that
cannot be good for anybody.
