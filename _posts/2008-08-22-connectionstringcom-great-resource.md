I just found this great site
[http://www.connectionstrings.com](http://www.connectionstrings.com/).
Here you'll find the answer to the age-old questions
on how to write the connection string for (almost)
every database provider.

[Some people](http://www.blogger.com/profile/06485708514192583267) has
know about this for a long, long time but haven't told me about it...
But I am not like that - here you go.
