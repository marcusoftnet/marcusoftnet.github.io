If you're looking for a simple way to share code snippets without the hassle of email or chat messages, [Pastie](http://www.pastie.org/) is a great tool.

Just visit the site, paste your code, optionally select a programming language, and you'll receive a URL to share your code snippet. It's a handy way to quickly get feedback or collaborate with others on coding problems.
