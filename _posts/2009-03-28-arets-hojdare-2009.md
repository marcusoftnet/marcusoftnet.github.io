Yesterday night
<a href="http://www.avegagroup.se" target="_blank">Avega</a> had a
party. Great fun as always and this night also presented the Avega Band
which was great (rock band mind you, I didn’t play).

There were a number of awards handed out during the evening (<a

target="_blank">SM i Affärsnytta</a> among others).

I was truly amazed when I was rewarded the “Årets höjdare” (Avegean of
the year, kinda…)!!! Last year it was
<a href="http://www.joakimsunden.com/" target="_blank">Joakim Sundén</a>
who is a great guy and really has put Avega on the IT-map of Sweden.

It is a reward that is voted on by the consultants of Avega.

Being completely taken off guard the only thing I could say at the time
was also the only thing I really felt: I am always very humbled when
meeting my colleagues in a group since you immediately can notice the
level of knowledge that exists in the firm. And that group of people
voted for me to be there favorite colleague!!!

Amazing! It is by far the finest reward I ever have received!

Thank you all!
