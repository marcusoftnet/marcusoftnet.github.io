In my [previous post](http://www.marcusoft.net/2010/01/aspnet-mvc-structuremap-and-tdd.html), I shared my frustrations with TDD and how to effectively start with it. **BDD** (Behavior Driven Development) seems to be the answer, but the .NET frameworks available for BDD can be quite perplexing. Many either have unconventional syntax or are built on top of other tools that are hard to work with.

**SpecFlow** appears to be a more approachable solution. It's designed with inspiration from **RSpec**, **Cucumber**, and Ruby, but tailored for the .NET and C# environment. It offers a more familiar style for .NET developers.

Check out the [SpecFlow website](http://www.specflow.org/) for more information. You can find a [silent screencast](http://www.specflow.org/specflow/screencast.aspx) that introduces its syntax and workflow, as well as [great resources](http://www.specflow.org/about/background.aspx) to get started.

Interestingly, SpecFlow even seems to support Swedish, as noted [here](http://github.com/techtalk/SpecFlow/tree/master/Tests/ParserTests/). Kudos to the [SpecFlow team](http://www.specflow.org/about/people.aspx) for their excellent work!

I plan to explore SpecFlow further as time allows. New assignment begins today, so I'll revisit this later.
