<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">

Apparently
<a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2014/04/thisIsHowIThink.html"
target="_blank">my last post</a> was not completely gibberish and
contained some thoughts that you could make use of. Thanks for the
feedback. Let me continue my train of thoughts here. It's not a very
long train, but it's still a train.
Here's where we ended: there's a customer, we are here to delight them
(thank you <a href="http://www.stevedenning.com/site/Default.aspx"
target="_blank">Stephen Deming</a> for that phrase). Everything we do
right now is just best so far in our strive to more effectively give
value to the customer. We can and should, change our current state,
process, organisation, tools or what have you, to try to improve. If we
do the change in bigger steps there will be bigger impacts in our
productivity, in smaller steps smaller impact.

See? Nothing really new or amazing here. In this post I wanted to talk a
little bit about where this can take us. Because I see this as a guiding
star, as a "true north", designed to draw improvements out of us. Taking
us to ideas, places and innovations better than we ever thought. It's a
bit "to infinity and beyond", I know.
I came to realise that a lot of the things that
we have around us today are innovations built out of necessity to make
things better, to improve the effectiveness (the rate with which we
reach our goal, if you remember). Just about every start-up company out
there grew out of urges like these.

My good friend
<a href="http://www.twitter.com/hakanforss" target="_blank">Håkan
Forss</a> talks a lot about improvements in small batches and have a
nice little picture as <a
href="http://hakanforss.wordpress.com/2014/03/30/are-you-too-busy-to-improve-focus-on-the-system/"
target="_blank">first slide of one of his latest presentation.</a>

Why did anyone come up with the preposterous idea of using wheels,
instead of the good all animal hides that we had been dragging our
things around on? Because it could move stuff faster. It would make my
customer happier, since I could move more seed to him. Hey, what did you
know?! It turns out it took less effort for me as well! Well - that's
awesome. Win-win!

Who knows? Someone probably tried square wheels for awhile. "I think
square wheels will be better than animal hides!". He put them on. And
part of the turn of the wheel was easier... but not really. And then
someone suggested a round one... Ah, not really maybe - but you see
where I'm going with this reasoning I think. They experimented. They saw
if it was better (moving stuff faster and easier) or not. If it was
better they improved it some more. If not they tried something else.

### Lean and agile

<div>

Why did Toyota come up with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Production_System"
target="_blank">Toyota Production System</a> (roughly what we westerners
calls lean)? Because they were smarter? Because they had someone there
to point the way? Because they had a tradition of improvements etc (oh,
well maybe that in fact...). 

</div>

<div>



</div>

<div>

I think, and I have not seen any evidence for this being true I confess,
that it had to do with the whole country being in ruins after the second
world war. They had nothing! No factories left. No raw material. Few
people. But they still decided that they could build cars for customers
that wanted them. 

</div>

<div>

In order to do so with their
<a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2013/01/on-constraints.html"
target="_blank">current constraints</a> they needed to focus on flowing
value through the system fast.

<div>

Focusing on reducing the time from order to car on your driveway. I see
customer focus. They could have focused on their internal process,
optimizing efficiency. But that was not their main goal, luckily. It was
the effectiveness of the system.

<a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/" target="_blank">Agile</a>. Same
thing. A bunch of really smart guys came together, because the IT
industry was really really bad on doing projects that succeeded, came in
on time or even finished (regardless of success or failure). Or if you
<a
href="http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/the-non-existent-software-crisis-debunki/240165910"
target="_blank">don't trust the CHAOS report</a>, at least this was
their experience (and mine, but they didn't invite me to the meeting...
I had a really strict spam-filter back then... yeah, that was probably
it). 

</div>

<div>

They <a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2013/10/YesITalkAboutChange.html"
target="_blank">changed how they did work</a>... in order to deliver
value to the customer, faster, and with better quality.
Customer-focused. 

</div>

<div>

You know what I think (or actually know, since I  seen and experienced
it); A LOT of people said that it was stupid. That it would  never work.
That it's just better for programmers. But I think they missed the whole
point. The point of agile (as I interpreter it) was to make improve the
output of the software process. Sure, by improving and changing the
fundamentals of how we do software development, but with the end goal of
improving for the customer.
Just think of all the things that we have been changing and how that
have been challenged, laughed at and dismissed, just because we were
content with our current state. If you like you can say

> "COME ON!? Than can never work. It's working fine as it is"

loudly, after each of these practices that today are mainstream. Do it
as a homage to the pioneers that have fought to use these, if nothing
else:

-   test driven development
-   involving customer in the software development process, early and
    continuously
-   pair programming
-   continuous delivery
-   \[agile practice \#24\]
-   \[agile practice that only you do in your context that have improved
    your effectiveness\]

### More examples?

I could go on and on. (Please continue to pay tribute to the unsung
heros pioneering respectively field...)

Yeah, I'm a simple man. It's a lot about software development in there.
That's where I get most of my experience. But you can probably come up
with a lot of examples in your domain, from your experience.

<div>



</div>

<div>

For each of the thing, in the list above, or what you come up with; I
promise you that it either came into being or caught on, because it
delivered value to a customer more effectively than the thing we did
before.

### Do you dare not investigate?

<div>

I have been very surprised about the reactions for some of the topics
that I follow these days; namely
<a href="http://zuill.us/WoodyZuill/category/estimating/"
target="_blank">#NoEstimates</a> and
<a href="http://scaledagileframework.com/" target="_blank">SAFe</a>.
 People that I have heard talking about improvements and continuously
evaluating and changing our current state has all of a sudden turned the
other way.  In all honesty it scared me away from posting anything
around those topic for awhile. I'm not afraid but I have better things
to do than being yelled at and called names etc.


<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

<a href="http://i.imgur.com/Og6PtyZ.jpg" data-imageanchor="1"
style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img
src="http://i.imgur.com/Og6PtyZ.jpg" data-border="0" width="200"
height="192" /></a>

</div>

Especially true is this around the \#NoEstimate topic. It seems to be
super-touchy for some people. "NO! We have to estimates! You cannot go
around telling/yelling to people that they should not doing that. It's
impossible."
It's really sad really, because just like NoSQL and Alt.Net
\#NoEstimates is not against anything but merely suggesting that we
should look for alternatives. For me that has a really nice ring, since
I think that just like planning, estimates is truly wasteful (as in
non-value adding).

Think back for yourself if you ever heard about a single customer for
any company that have been impressed with their planning and estimating.
No - we (or they depending on which side of the fence you're on) want
value. Output. We don't care much about the inside of the machine. Do
whatever you need to do to continue to produce awesome, thank you.


</div>

<div>

Come closer to the screen. I let you in on a secret. It will blow the
lid of all your current knowledge and completely turn your world up side
down. Closer... There. Are you ready?

<span style="font-size: x-small;">You know what... Agile is not the
answer. Lean is not the answer. No Estimates is not the answer. We will
find new ways. </span>We will improve. Like in Jurassic park: 

</div>

> <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/532440-life-will-find-a-way"
> target="_blank">Life will find a way</a> - Michael Crichton

We simply don't know where we will end up. Trying to improve will leads
us down paths that we today think is utterly impossible. In that light.
Do you dare? Do you dare not investigating improving? Do you dare
dismiss things just because you think it sounds preposterous? Or should
you maybe instead try to find quick ways to try and find out what works
for you.

### How can I start?

<div style="text-align: left;">

Oh my... this post became longer that initially intended. But let me
wrap by trying to answer the obvious question; what can I do? I have no
power. My boss, my client, my \[imposing title that you cannot challenge
here\] simply will not listen.

I have devised a training plan for you (and me) to get us. They are both
very simple but will take you far:


1.  Figure out who your customer is. Dare ask "Why are we here?" Hint;
    it's not "the business" or the project manager. It's the one paying
    your bills...
2.  Change something in *your* environment for the better to improve
    your effectiveness in producing value for that customer. Start with
    something that you control and can change. Do small things first.
    Trivial stuff, but with the customer in mind. Motivate your change
    with increased value for the customer. Remember that you can do
    experiments that you think will improve your effectiveness and then
    evaluate.
3.  Try to do such small changes at least once a week, preferably one
    everyday. 
4.  Read
    <a href="http://heathbrothers.com/books/switch" target="_blank">Switch -
    how to change things when change is hard</a>. It's full of
    motivational stories of people with no or little power, money and
    influence that have change big organisations and even countries in
    some cases. 
5.  Start from 2 again. Repeat and reach wider and wider. Start asking
    questions on "Why we are here?"

<div>

This is a little exercise that I have going in my head. Yes, I have read
Switch many times. Five now, I think. It helps me sort out my thoughts
about change and getting others onboard.
