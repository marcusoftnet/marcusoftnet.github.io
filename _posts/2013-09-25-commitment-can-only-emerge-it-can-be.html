<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">One of the things that I really love with my job is that you meet a lot of excellent people at the different clients. Some of these people are seldom heard from since they are drowned in the output of those extrovert, space-demanding people that inhabits the blogosphere and twitter. Yes, the people like me.<br /><br /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://shoryuken.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Gems4.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="149" src="http://shoryuken.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Gems4.jpg" width="200" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">From&nbsp;http://shoryuken.com/</td></tr></tbody></table>Right now I'm at <a href="http://www.tradera.com/" target="_blank">Tradera</a>&nbsp;and meet a lot of those awesome, cloaked gems of knowledge, people <br />everyday. One of them is called Andreas Johansson (no twitter, no blog - see what I mean) and every time I get to sit down and discuss with him I learn stuff and gain insights.<br /><br /><a name='more'></a><br />A couple of weeks ago we talked about commitment, and he said something profound:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">You cannot demand commitment. It's something that emerges in working teams.&nbsp;</blockquote>&nbsp;My translation, sorry Andreas if I didn't made it justice.<br /><br />Commitment is one of those really misused and misunderstood terms from&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)" target="_blank">Scrum</a>. That is the intent of the word in Scrum is misused, there's nothing wrong with the term itself. But you cannot:<br /><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Tell the team to commit to the scope of the sprint. Oh well you can, but it won't happen. Commitment doesn't work that way</li><li>Hold them accountable for a commitment you demanded from them.</li><li>Have them say aloud that they commit to a scope (yes, I've heard about things like that).&nbsp;</li></ul><div><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.jollybengali.net/amrikanchimaera/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/fullmetaljacket.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="150" src="http://www.jollybengali.net/amrikanchimaera/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/fullmetaljacket.jpg" width="200" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">From&nbsp;http://www.jollybengali.net/</td></tr></tbody></table>In fact just thinking about saying "Commit!" in imperative is laughable. No... really. I'm laughing right now.<br /><br />Just as it's equally stupid to say: "Care about this! Now! Deeply!"<br /><br />That's easy enough to understand. But still we see that over and over. From people using agile. Agile. You know... people saying that they value&nbsp;<a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/" target="_blank">"individuals and interactions" and "customer collaboration"</a>.<br /><br />What you, as a product owner or stakeholder, can do is to give a team freedom, support and autonomy over HOW they will work and help them understand WHY you <a href="http://youtu.be/gJLIiF15wjQ?t=49s" target="_blank">really, really want</a> this thing you want them to build. And answer any question they might need you for around the WHAT.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>And if you do, you might, just might see commitment emerge. Commitment that could manifest itself in:</div><div><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Delivering a better product, than even you expected</li><li>Building it faster, than you hoped</li><li>Caring about the quality and taking care of it</li><li>Being proud over what they/you have made. So proud that they continue to care about "our product"</li></ul><div>In short; you might find a team that stand behind the product.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>So in short: Don't demand commitment. You can demand stuff but it's not commitment. You can support a team to feel empowered, proud and involved. And if you're lucky... you might see commitment emerge. &nbsp;</div></div><div><br /></div><div>Thanks Andy for pointing that out to me. Love talking to you!</div></div>
