I got the
opportunity to play with [Stockholms
Brass Band](http://www.stockholmbrass.se/) this weekend. First baritone
this time.

What a great bunch of guys! Really nice people and the playing was at a
very high level. If they met a little more often they could kick some
serious ... in any competition.

Yesterday Håkan Björkman, solo trombonist of the Royal
Swedish Opera, blew the audience away with a <span

class="blsp-spelling-corrected">unbelievable performance of a
<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_7" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">crazy
hard piece called Doolalynastics. What a player! I am
truly amazed of his skills.

[Here is a video](http://www.stockholmbrass.se/Videoklipp.htm) from the
concert when we are playing the marsch Celebrate Rotary.
