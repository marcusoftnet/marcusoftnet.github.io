I got the opportunity to play with [Stockholm's Brass Band](http://www.stockholmbrass.se/) this weekend. First baritone this time.

What a great bunch of guys! Really nice people and the playing was at a very high level. If they met a little more often they could kick some serious ... in any competition.

Yesterday Håkan Björkman, solo trombonist of the Royal Swedish Opera, blew the audience away with a unbelievable performance of a crazy hard piece called Doolalynastics. What a player! I am truly amazed of his skills.

[Here is a video](http://www.stockholmbrass.se/Videoklipp.htm) from the concert when we are playing the march Celebrate Rotary.
