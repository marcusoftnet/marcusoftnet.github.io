I got the
<span>="blsp-spelling-corrected">opportunity</span> to play with [<span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-error">Stockholms</span>
Brass Band](http://www.stockholmbrass.se/) this weekend. First baritone
this time.

What a great bunch of guys! Really nice people and the playing was at a
very high level. If they met a little more often they could kick some
serious ... in any competition.

Yesterday <span>="blsp-spelling-error">Håkan</span> <span>="blsp-spelling-error">Björkman</span>, <span>="blsp-spelling-corrected">solo trombonist</span> of the Royal
Swedish Opera, blew the <span>="blsp-spelling-corrected">audience</span> away with a <span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_6"
class="blsp-spelling-corrected">unbelievable</span> performance of a
<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_7" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">crazy</span>
hard piece called <span>="blsp-spelling-error">Doolalynastics</span>. What a player! I am
truly amazed of his skills.

[Here is a video](http://www.stockholmbrass.se/Videoklipp.htm) from the
concert when we are playing the <span>="blsp-spelling-error">marsch</span> Celebrate Rotary.
