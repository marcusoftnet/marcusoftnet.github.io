<div class="p1">

This is the second post on my top 5 ways of making sure that your agile
change initiative succeeds. But this is not ideas made up in my head (MY
GOD - the horrors...) but things that I've tried and failed miserably
with. Over and over. And learned a lot from.

</div>

<div class="p1">

This is the list - in order of importance:

</div>

1. <a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2012/10/agilechangetop51.html"
    target="_blank">Get a great "Or else"-reason for doing this change</a>
2. <a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2012/10/agilechangetop52.html"
    target="_blank">Sit together</a>
3. <a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2012/10/agilechangetop53.html"
    target="_blank">Let them change how they work</a>
4. <a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2012/10/agilechangetop54.html"
    target="_blank">Support the initiative</a> (this post)
5. <a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2012/10/agilechangetop55.html"
    target="_blank">Use visualised data to improve</a>

### 4 - Support the initiative

<div>

This should be a no-brainer but once you see it in action it's seldom
handled correctly.

</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>

If you want to change how people act and work you have to be a role
model for that, supporting the new ways. This means that the change must
start with management. Yes - start. No - it is not enough that they are
informed, on a need-to-know basis. They need to know how to support the
teams to improve. To help them avoid falling back into the old ways of
working.

</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>

Before somebody says it; I know that I just (#3) said that you should
let people organize themselves in the way they see fit. But such freedom
need to be supported from above. So we have a vision (the WHY) and
support for the change from above and the actual change happening
organically from the bottom up.

</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>

Let me give an example on what I mean:

</div>

<div>

If we saw that we're going to create a learning organization we need to
make room for that learning. Managers must support this and for example,
allow for slack. Managers cannot **say** that we want to create a
learning organization and at the same time require that everybody are
shipping in the required hours. That is sending two signals at once.

</div>

<div>

The support from above need to be given on the floor. Walking around,
being interested, asking questions and coaching the teams to continue
improving. Hmmm - sounds like the things that a boss **should** be
doing, right?

</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>

There are strong forces at play here. At one client I was told not to
talk about slack and learning since that manager had his bonus
calculated from the allocation percentage of his employees. If they
worked 100% he got more money. Even if they did stupid, non productive
work. And learned nothing.

</div>

<div>

But we were going to create a learning organization...  

</div>

<div>

It doesn't add up.

</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>

So in order to succeed I would say that everybody above the teams need
to not only know what going on, but also be trained enough to give the
support and coaching that the organization needs. So that we are sure
we're not sending the wrong signals.

</div>

<div>

It goes without saying that we need to buy into this. You need a great
"or else"-reason. Starting to see that it's important, huh?

</div>
