<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">

We are working a lot with
<a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2014/09/accountability.html"
target="_blank">trust and transparency</a> in my current team.
Specifically on the transparency item one "trick" we have been using is
to cc the entire team in as many conversations as possible.

I picked this practice up from the
<a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank">Stripe company</a> and
specifically <a href="http://blog.alexmaccaw.com/stripes-culture"
target="_blank">this article</a>, which is a great read if you haven't
seen it before.

Yes, they cc the whole company on everything. And I've seen this
practice in action at Spotify to certain extent as well.

By now some of you need oxygen; MY GOD! My inbox will be flooded. And
how could anyone be expected to read all of that?! Do these people do
any real work?

There's three comments that needs to be made here, that I have repeated
a lot when trying to implement this in all kinds of teams;

First; you are **not expected to read or act on this**. CC stands for
Carbon (moahahaha!) Copy and simply means that you get a copy. I'd
suggest you train the rest of your organisation in how to properly us
this and DO not answer to emails that you are CC on, only to the ones
sent TO you.

Secondly (related to the first); **get good at using the email tool**
and help others to become better too. I have a very simple rule that
takes everything that I am cc-ed on and just put it in a separate
folder; "Inbox - CC". I read that when I have time over.

Thirdly (and most important): there's a **symbolic value in sharing the
information with everyone**. We *trust* each other to let everyone in on
all the things. We *trust* each other to act wisely with that
information. We believe that more minds are better than fewer and strive
to become more and more transparent with our information.

### Summary

The main idea here is not that everyone knows everything all the time,
but you *already* have that information at your finger tips. You can
just find it in your email. It's already there!

We don't expect you to act on everything - but you are encourage to take
part and offer your opinion in matters that are important and
interesting to you.

This is where we trying to go.
CC all the things!

You already have that information.
We share everything
