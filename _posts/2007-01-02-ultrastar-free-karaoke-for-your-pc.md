Had great fun with this program at New Years Eve

<http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/ultrastar/>

If you have songs you want to karaoke but UltraStar doesn't support them
you can easily (kinda :)) be created. [Follow these
instructions.](http://ultrastarstuff.com/html/makeasong.html)

I must confess that i have had some preconceived thoughts about singing
karaoke - but i stand corrected. It's really funny! Will be a
standard-item on parties at my house from now on.
