<p>I am going through the <a href="http://aspnetmvcbook.s3.amazonaws.com/aspnetmvc-nerdinner_v1.pdf" target="_blank">free sample chapter</a> that I talked about <a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2009/03/sprint-planner-helper-session-20.html">earlier</a>. It’s one thick chapter (196 pages) but it’s really good to introduce concepts and features of the <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/" target="_blank">ASP.NET MVC</a> framework. </p>  <p>I love it! I cannot say anything else when after a few years of WebForms and me not understanding I am back. I actually get this – no more funky event-firing and endless questions about which event is fired first. </p>  <p>On top of that the whole framework is built and works very well to be tested and built with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development" target="_blank">TDD</a> . </p>  <p>There are so many nice little features that I just cannot wait to know as the backside of my hand… UpdateModel and ModelState just to mention a few. </p>  <p>I am now halfway through and will continue to the end. I’ll get back to you if anything more great appears. </p>  <p>PS.   <br />I think this is the way we will build web applications from now on. I know I will…</p>
