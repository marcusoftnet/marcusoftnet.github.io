Just
read that the YBS Band are looking forward and keeps a positive
attitude. That's what I like! See the positive - even in the dark
situations.

I know about a story about the times when Watson took over Black Dyke.
After two rehearsals the band consisted of only 5 players. But that
didn't get them down. Apparently Robert Childs said: "Great - now we can
build the band we want!". That's cool!

I still cheer for YBS. Keep going!
