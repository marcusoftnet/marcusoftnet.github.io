Who's up for a meeting?
Whoopie - another meeting!

Experienced that? No - didn't think so either.
Most of us hate meetings, and sadly not without reason many times. But a
thing that really bugs me is when this culture is classifying meetings
as non-work. In our business there seems to be lot of people (*cough*
developers *cough*) that think that the only real work is pushing down
the keys on a keyboard. Preferably writing code.

This can take strange expressions sometimes; we seems to think that
writing long, emails and sending them back and forth is work but not
sitting in a meeting and clear stuff out instead. Strange indeed.

And furthermore - we want to meet more. We want to have a lot of
frequent face-to-face interactions. This is in the core of agile and
common sense. In fact -
<a href="https://twitter.com/marcusoftnet/status/217578147690979329"
target="_blank">it's my best tips to becoming more agile</a>. So going
agile (or lean or whatever you wanna call it) will often result in more
meetings. Not a very good thing if people think that this not work.

Meetings are a great way of communicating a lot of information.
Face-to-face is superior any other communication form in that regard.
But often we waste our opportunity by missing simple things.

Readers of this blog know that I love the
<a href="http://www.heathbrothers.com/switch/" target="_blank">Switch
book by the Heath brothers</a> and it's pragmatic approach to accomplish
change. I've already tried to apply the thinking in their <a
href="http://www.heathbrothers.com/resources/download/switch-framework.pdf"
target="_blank">Switch Framework</a> to <a
href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2011/12/applying-switch-framework-to-broken.html"
target="_blank">Broken builds being ignored</a> and <a
href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2012/05/applying-switch-framework-to-developers.html"
target="_blank">Developers don't want to test</a>. I thought that this
could be a good fit; Applying the Switch framework to Meetings are not
work.


### Switch framework

<div>

You'll need some introduction to the framework. Please (really do -
it'll change your life)
<a href="http://www.heathbrothers.com/switch/" target="_blank">read the
book</a> to get the full picture

In the book the image of the human psyche is introduced, which they in
turn have borrowed from Jonathan Haidt. The rest of the book is built
around this picture.  The images is a Rider on an Elephant. The elephant
is our emotion and the rider is our rational side. The rider controls
the elephant with some reins from his topside position. The only problem
is that if the six-ton elephant wants to go into the bushes to have
something to eat … those reins will not help much.

</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>

In order to accomplish change you will have to address both the rider
and the elephant part of people. The rider need clear instructions while
the elephant need motivation and some reasons for why this should be
done. Finally you need to shape the path on which they are going to be
traveling. The Switch framework gives you some guidelines on how to
accomplish that. 

</div>

</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>

Under the headings; Direct the rider, Motivate the elephant and Shape
the path (they both are heading down) Chip and Dan Heath gives a lot of
tips, and stories that help us understand to address both parts of the
human psyche when we introduce change. Resulting in a much
higher probability of the change to happen and

### Follow the bright spots

<div>

One very effective and simple way to get change is to follow the bright
spots. What works? Who has got this down? Where is the best place to see
the change implemented today?

<div>

In the Switch book a story around this is about a doctor trying to help
poor peasants to overcome starvation and save children that died from
not having enough to eat. What he simply did was to see what the mothers
did for the kids that actually survived - because those existed. They
did simple things differently (for example feeding the kids 4 times a
day instead of 2 (same amount of food in total) or adding other
vegetables instead of rice every now and then). 

</div>

<div>

The guy trying to help them out simple pointed to this and thought
this behavior to the other mother with a great effect as a result. 

</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>

In our case we could ask ourselves; which meetings are great? (yes, now
you all sadly said NONE together but I don't think it's true), when was
the last time you felt that you had attended a great meeting? What
happend then?

</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>

For me personal it's quite simple things; 

</div>

<div>

-   I came out the meeting and felt that we actually accomplished
    something. We have decided or made something in the meeting. Or
    better yet - we all learned something in the progress. 
-   Also when I felt that everybody in the room had their place and we
    couldn't have come to the same great result without everybody
    present - that also is a great meeting for me. 
-   Not dragging out - great meetings may even feel a bit too short.
-   Not technical hiccups - leaving us all the time we wanted for the
    actual content instead of messing around trying to show slides
    correctly. 

</div>

<div>

If you look around your organisation you will most definitely find
people that do this already. If not all of it so some or at least
sometimes. What can you do to follow that? How can you get them to do
more of it and always hold great meetings?

</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>

In the next section we will take a look at some more down to earth tips
on how to make it work in practice.

</div>

### Script the critical moves

<div>

Under this heading the Switch authors talk about
simple, prescriptive behaviors that we can follow without thinking to
much and end up in a better way. For me it comes back to Shu-Ha-Ri from
martial arts.

|                                   From http://www.rochdalekarate.com/                                   |

<div>

Shu Ha Ri the reasoning about how you learn new techniques in martial
arts.

</div>

<div>

**Shu** means Obey the rules - do exactly what the sensei tells you. Do
it over and over again until it's second nature. This is what Script the
critical moves is all about. 

</div>

<div>

**Ha** means roughly Break the rules. Try something new that you haven't
done before. But do that taking a stance in the basic rules you know.

</div>

<div>

**Ri** means Leave the rules. Make up new rules for yourself. When you
are the master you can make up new techniques. 

</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>

So here we want some really simple rules or guidelines to follow. In our
case this can be as simple as guidelines for how to hold effective
meetings, that are distributed to all meeting rooms, for example. And
probably taught to the whole organisation. Why not when you are hired? 

</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>

For simple rules I would go with for example these (some <a
href="http://michaelhyatt.com/seven-rules-for-more-effective-meetings.html"
target="_blank">ideas borrowed from here</a>):

</div>

<div>

-   Write a great **Invite** - make sure that you only invite the people
    that are needed. Make sure they know why they are there and why they
    are needed in order to accomplish the goal of the meeting. 
-   Have a clear **Outcome** or Goal for the meeting. State the goal in
    the beginning; "We are here to X! Let's go!" or "After this meeting
    we will have done/reached Y"
-   **Timebox** the meeting - adjust the content of the meeting to a
    certain time and not the other way around. In this way people know
    when they are available again and can trust on it being so. Start
    with just having 45 min meetings instead of the ubiquitous 1 hour. 
-   Offer each other the **Focus** gift - when we're in this short
    meeting (it is short, right?) we are focused. Put away computers and
    phones on a table at the door. This will also send a signal about
    you being really serious about the focus. 
-   Before you leave make sure that **Actions** are clear and with an
    owner and a due date. 

<div>

**UPDATE:** ~~Don't try to make an abbreviation of that ... I tried
and dislocated my tongue trying to say it out loud...~~ Thanks to the
excellent
<a href="https://twitter.com/chibbeu" target="_blank">@chibbeu (Christer
Unestrand)</a> there's now an excellent abbreviation for this. FAT I/O -
make sure that your meetings are using it! I'm here by claiming rights
to that abbreviation FAT I/O (tm). 

</div>

</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>

Seriously - try to have a few simple rules that everybody can follow.
Post them everywhere. And teach them to everyone. So that people that
are conducting bad meetings are reminded by the attendees on how to do
it better. 

</div>

### Point to the destination

<div>

This is my favorite point. And a great trick for getting there faster.
It goes like this; "Imagine a world where ... ". You simply paint or
make up the future as it will become when we make all these changes.
When we get there!

</div>


It's a great way to show the goal to everyone involved in the change we
undertaking. Let this be a vision, something that we might never reach
but is well worth reaching FOR.

In our case we could talk about:

-   I only attend important meetings
-   Every meeting being productive
-   Coming out more energized that you went in
-   No more fully booked calendars
-   Every person in the meeting contributes

<div>

You can probably do much better than me when it comes to come up with
a beautiful future. 

</div>

### Conclusion

<div>

I've deliberately not talked about meeting free days or having fewer
meetings here. I think those can be great for productivity but I'm also
afraid that they may reinforce that meetings are not real work. And we
don't want that. Quite the opposite in fact - we want the meetings we
have to feel important and fun. 

</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>

Yes - we could probably cut down on the actual number as well, but that
will probably happen when you start to ask questions on why we're
holding the meeting. 

</div>


In this post I have tried different ways of addressing the Rider - the
one that could reason about this and really know how a great meeting
should be. In the <a
href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2012/09/applying-switch-framework-to-meetings_20.html"
target="_blank">next post I'll try to reason with the Elephant</a> -
the subconscious that rather just hack away on the code instead of
talking of a lot of people that simply don't get it...
