I found a site that held a gold nugget. At first I didn’t see it but at
the bottom of the page there was a list with some very interesting web
cast on agile things; Kanban, Agile Design, TDD, Pair programming etc.

Here is one example; a webcast that promise to “<a
href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/agile-scrum/debugging-pair-programming"
target="_blank">Debug Pair Programming</a>”. It’s shows some of the
problems you might run into when introducing pair programming and how to
solve them.

At the lower part of the page you’ll find many other pod and webcasts.
For example:

-   <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/agile-scrum/agile-design"
    target="_blank">Agile Design with Alan Shalloway</a>
-   <a
    href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/agile-scrum/fast-track-test-driven-development-testify-your-project"
    target="_blank">Fast Track Test-Driven Development: Testify your project
    with David Evans</a>
-   <a
    href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/agile-scrum/the-future-of-software-intensive-product-development"
    target="_blank">Is Lean the inevitable future for software-intensive
    product development?</a> with Flow Chain Sensei (say that three
    times really fast, I dare you…)
