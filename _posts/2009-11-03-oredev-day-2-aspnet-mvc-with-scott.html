Now we're getting into the "real stuff" or rather IT-related stuff. <div><br /></div><div>I am now attending a session with <a href="http://odetocode.com/blogs/scott/">Scott Allen</a>, who is a great guy by the way, on <a href="http://www.asp.net/mVC/">ASP.NET MVC</a>. As readers of this blog know I love this framework already since it got me back on understanding web development again. </div><div><br /></div><div>OK - since Scott is dropping god nuggets as he speak, I thought that I put it here as we go, in no particular order;</div><div><ul><li>When you create the "URL template" for routing you can specify anything you want. For example {controller}/{action}/{category}/{locale} would fill the category and local with anything passed to the URL or null if not set. </li><li>Learn and use <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/MVCContrib">MVC Contrib</a></li><li><a href="http://www.codeplex.com/MVCContrib"></a>Set the projectfile-setting <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/383192/compile-views-in-asp-net-mvc">MvcBuildViews</a> to get compilation errors for errors in the views.  This slows builds down so don't use it when not needed.</li><li>Test your routing with <a href="http://flux88.com/blog/fluent-route-testing-in-asp-net-mvc/">Fluent HTML Testing Routes</a></li><li>Check out <a href="http://www.asp.net/LEARN/mvc/tutorial-14-cs.aspx">ActionFilters</a> to be able to hook into the "events" of the action methods; OnActionExcecuting, OnActionExecuted etc.</li><li>I got a big aha-moment when Scott described the Execute-method of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd504937(VS.100).aspx">IController</a>-interface. Especially check out the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.routing.requestcontext(VS.100).aspx">RequestContext</a> object sent to the Execute-method, that contains RouteData-dictionary. There you have your route-template values...</li><li>I can't believe that <a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2009/03/updatemodel-formcollection-and-unit_5466.html">I've forgot</a> about <a href="http://davidhayden.com/blog/dave/archive/2008/09/08/ASPNETMVCUpdateModelTryUpdateModelDataBinding.aspx">UpdateModel</a>. It's a good thing - but sending the strong type is better :)</li><li>Build your own <a href="http://www.asp.net/learn/mvc/tutorial-09-cs.aspx">HTML helper methods</a> for everything except the trivial HTML-generation. "If you ever have a if-statment in your view use a HTML helper" - was the exact quote.</li><li>The web.config in the View-folder is just to get people not to try to pull down your views directly.</li></ul><div>Thank you Scott for a great overview.  I link the slides here when available.</div></div>
