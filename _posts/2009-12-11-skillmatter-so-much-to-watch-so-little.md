On the [SkillsMatter](http://skillsmatter.com) site there are so many good things to read and see that I would have to spend a month just streaming video.

Just take a look at the categories:

- [Agile testing & BDD](http://skillsmatter.com/go/agile-testing)
- [Architecture & DDD](http://skillsmatter.com/go/design-architecture)
- [Open source .NET](http://skillsmatter.com/go/open-source-dot-net)
- [Agile PM & Scrum](http://skillsmatter.com/go/agile-scrum)
- [Cloud & RIA](http://skillsmatter.com/go/cloud-grid)

OK – the minute I have a few weeks to spare… yeah right!
