The [issue that I had](https://www.marcusoft.net/2009/03/aspnet-mvc-running-transformation-error.html) with creating views for nested classes is solved with a new release of the [ASP.NET MVC](http://www.asp.net/mvc/) RC.

Thanks to some very fast response from [Phil Haack](http://haacked.com/), I’ve got to know about a new release of the framework. Here is [the link to the RC II of the ASP.NET MVC](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=ee4b2e97-8a72-449a-82d2-2f720d421031).

Worked fine and as I said solved my problem.
