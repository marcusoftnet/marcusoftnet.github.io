In a previous post I briefly referred to [Sharp
Architecture](http://code.google.com/p/sharp-architecture/) (what’s the
thing with the funky spelling?).

I have now read a bit about it and I must push for it harder. It’s rock
good! What an ambitious project!

The idea is to give you a boiler-plate architecture that contains best
practices and useable functionality when doing
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design"
target="_blank">DDD</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development"
target="_blank">TDD</a>, 
<a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/" target="_blank">ASP.NET MVC</a> and
<a href="https://www.hibernate.org/343.html"
target="_blank">NHibernate</a>.

You know – the way you always feel when a project is done… “This is so
good that it easily could be a framework, if only …” – These guys has
done it for you.

It’s not done and still have a bit to go before but I really like it.

Check it out. Here are some introduction videos:
