In a previous post, I briefly referred to [Sharp Architecture](http://code.google.com/p/sharp-architecture/) (what’s the thing with the funky spelling?).

I have now read a bit about it, and I must push for it harder. It’s rock good! What an ambitious project!

The idea is to give you a boiler-plate architecture that contains best practices and usable functionality when doing [DDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design), [TDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development), [ASP.NET MVC](http://www.asp.net/mvc/), and [NHibernate](https://www.hibernate.org/343.html).

You know – the way you always feel when a project is done… “This is so good that it easily could be a framework, if only …” – These guys have done it for you.

It’s not done and still has a bit to go, but I really like it.

Check it out. Here are some introduction videos:
