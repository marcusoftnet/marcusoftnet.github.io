After my last post i feel the need to write something positive, since
that only mad me angry...

Right now i feel so good with my life! There are so many things, people
and things to do that makes me happy everyday. Here are a shortlist:

-   <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-error"
    onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)">Elin - i am so lucky to
    have met her. We have so much fun together and she alone could be
    the reason for me being happy.
-   <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-error"
    onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)">Vasa - i really enjoy the
    Salvation Army corps i am at right now.
-   <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-error"
    onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)">VasaBand - and the band in
    that corps. Great guys, great band. The fellowship and the
    dedication to God is <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_3"
    class="blsp-spelling-corrected">genuine and good. It makes me
    come closer to God each day.
-   <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_4"
    class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Euphonium playing - i am
    right now in "the flow" for my <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_5"
    class="blsp-spelling-error"
    onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)">euphonium playing, and have
    some very <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_6"
    class="blsp-spelling-corrected">interesting "project" coming
    up

Altogether that make me feel great and makes me cope with other things
that not is equally fun. But hey, you need salt and sugar in your life,
don't you?
