Went to a wedding for a friend of mine this weekend. The wedding
itself was very nice with some wonderful music, both the bride and groom
are great musicians. Andreas had composed the entry march
and arranged some other pieces. Then the program contained two lovely
singers.

I also got the opportunity and honor to play for
the happy couple, You raise me up. I had a wonderful <span

class="blsp-spelling-corrected">accompaniment from the piano and
it all went very well.

The evening and party afterwards was very nice indeed. I have to confess
that sometimes weddings can get a bit long and ... well to be frank
boring. But this was very nice. As always some interesting
details about the couple was revealed.

As for the rest of the weekend we spent it with the young part of the
"in-law" relatives. Very nice - I am so fortunate to have such nice
relatives. Even six hours drives just flies away.
