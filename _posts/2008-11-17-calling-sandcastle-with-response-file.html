I've been generating documentation from our XML-comments with <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Sandcastle" target="_blank">Sandcastle</a> for quite some time now. It has worked alright but there were some stuff that really annoyed me, I though that I had to put up with it. <br />But this is the beauty of my line of work comes into play... all of a sudden we've got a new team member. Christer Cederborg from Avega (of course) - a great guy and very knowledgeable in things like build scripts and other. And you get to learn from each other. This is why I am in this business - sharing and knowing.<br />OK - Christer told me that you can use something called a response file to send commands to <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Sandcastle" target="_blank">Sandcastle</a>. The response file is in fact just the parameters you would send to <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Sandcastle" target="_blank">Sandcastle</a> the command line, but in a file. This made us go around the use of <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/SHFB" target="_blank">.shfb</a>-files. <br /><a href="http://www.codeplex.com/SHFB" target="_blank">Sandcastle Help File Builder</a> is certainly a great tool when you generate the documentation manually but is sucks when it comes to incorporating it into a build script. You cannot use wildcards or relative paths in .shfb-files which complicate things in a major way. I actually created two separate file, one for local developer use and one for our build script. They were of course almost always out of sync...<br />But with the use of a response file you can set all the commands you need to <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Sandcastle" target="_blank">Sandcastle</a> and get the same result. Here is a short extract from our response file:<br /><blockquote>-assembly=SystemName.*.dll, SystemName.*.xml      <br />-dependency=Microsoft.Practices*      <br />-dependency=System.Dependency*<br />-VisibleItems="InheritedMembers, InheritedFrameworkMembers, Protected, SealedProtected"<br />-ShowMissingParams=true     <br />-ShowMissingRemarks=false      <br />-ShowMissingReturns=true</blockquote>And here is how to call <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Sandcastle" target="_blank">Sandcastle</a> in MsBuild with the use of the response file:<br /><blockquote>&lt;PropertyGroup&gt;     <br />&lt;!-- Sandcastle parameters --&gt;      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;SandCastleExePath&gt;C:\Program Files\EWSoftware\Sandcastle Help File Builder\SandcastleBuilderConsole.exe&lt;/SandCastleExePath&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;SandCastleOuputLocation&gt;$(DropLocation)\SystemDokumentation\Tjanster&lt;/SandCastleOuputLocation&gt;     <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;SandCastleWorkingDir&gt;$(CurrentSolutionRoot)\SandCastleWorkingDir&lt;/SandCastleWorkingDir&gt;      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;SandCastleResponseFile&gt;$(CurrentSolutionRoot)\Solution Items\Documentation\SystemName.SandCastleSettings.txt&lt;/SandCastleResponseFile&gt;<br />&lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;<br /><br />&lt;Target Name="GenerateDocumentation" Condition="'$(Documentation)' == 'true'"&gt;     <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;!-- Clean directories --&gt;      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;RemoveDir Directories="$(SandCastleOuputLocation)" /&gt;      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;MakeDir Directories="$(SandCastleOuputLocation)" /&gt;      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;RemoveDir Directories="$(SandCastleWorkingDir)" /&gt;      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;MakeDir Directories="$(SandCastleWorkingDir)" /&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;!-- Create the documentation with call to Sandcastle with the parameters of the response-file --&gt;     <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Exec WorkingDirectory="$(OutDir)"      <br />Command="&amp;quot;$(SandCastleExePath)&amp;quot; @&amp;quot;$(SandCastleResponseFile)&amp;quot; -workingpath=&amp;quot;$(SandCastleWorkingDir)&amp;quot; -outputPath=&amp;quot;$(SandCastleOuputLocation)&amp;quot;" /&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;!-- Clean working directory --&gt;     <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;RemoveDir Directories="$(SandCastleWorkingDir)" /&gt;      <br />&lt;/Target&gt;<br /><span style="color: #333333; font-size: x-small;"></span></blockquote>
