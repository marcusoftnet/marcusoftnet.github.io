<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">

Just passed [this
"trick"](http://blogs.msdn.com/ddysart/archive/2006/07/06/658295.aspx).
You'd think that everything that there is in notepad was known...

This is cool and could also be handy for creating a manual notebook or
diary .


1.  Open a blank Notepad file
2.  Write .LOG (in uppercase) in the first line of the file, followed by
    Enter. Save the file and close it.
3.  Double-click the file to open it and notice that Notepad appends the
    current date and time to the end of the file and places the cursor
    on the line after.
4.  Type your notes and then save and close the file.
5.  Each time you open the file, Notepad repeats the process, appending
    the time and date to the end of the file and placing the cursor
    below it.
