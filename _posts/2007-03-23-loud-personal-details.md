I'm
sorry but the women at my workspace that talks loud about all (i mean
all) details is going on my nerves...

Every morning there is something about her children forgetting keys and
sleeping over, or why not something even more personal?

And it's loud - i could probably tape it and make some kind of <span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">diary for
her...
