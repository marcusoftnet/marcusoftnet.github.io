Well the title really says it all, but there's big changes coming for me
and my family this autumn. We're moving to [Bandung,
Indonesia](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Bandung,+West+Java,+Indonesia&hl=en&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=47.215051,92.724609&oq=Bandung,+Indonesia&t=h&hnear=Bandung,+West+Java,+Indonesia&z=12&iwloc=A) to
work at a hospital for the [Salvation
Army](http://www.salvationarmy.org/) there.
That statement may cause some questions to arise in your head. Let me
see if I can foresee them?

### Why?

There's three big answers to that question and they come in
chronological order. On my first date with Elin (8 years ago now, my
wife since 6 years) she told me that she wanted to work abroad. In a
"developing country". That's her life long dream and the reason
she's decided to become a nurse in the first place. Now the opportunity
has come to fulfill that dream - and I get to be part of it!

Secondly: I have the Salvation Army to thank for so many things. Things
that I use in my everyday life at work and other places. It's due to the
Salvation Army that I got public speaking training since I was five. Due
to the Salvation Army I have learned how to teach from an early age.
I've been a leader in different groups I've been part in since I was 16.
But mostly I have a faith that I've always can rely on and support me in
rough times (technically that's not the Salvation Army - that's God...
but they are closely related to me).
All these things has been given to me just because I'm part of this
amazing, world wide organization. For free. And I've had a great time
doing it.

If I can pay back by trying to do good for people that needs help, in
God and the Salvation Army's name - I'll happily do that.

Finally: take a look around yourself and everything that most of us
have. We own so much, we live relatively easy lives, we struggle very
little. But there's people in the other end of that scale. Maybe, just
maybe I can be involved in helping some of them.

So... I'll do this for God and Elin. And the Salvation Army. And me -
it's probably the adventure of an lifetime.

### When?

Soon. September actually. After about 4 years of applications and
holding back due to newly-borns, kid diseases and bad timing the time
has now come. The final decision was made this Thursday and they want us
to come as soon as we can. With visas, vaccinations and fixing stuff
with the apartment and work and other things that'll be in september.  

### What?

We'll be working (both of us) for a Salvation Army hospital in Bandung,
West Java, Indonesia. Elin will be a "Human Resources Development
Consultant for Hospital" and I'm a "Project and Facilities consultant
for Hospital Foundation". It's a project for three years.

I have been doing contracting work for about 18 years now. I know that a
work title and description doesn't mean that much until you get to do it
in practices. We'll see how it plays out. I'm confident that my
<a href="https://www.marcusoft.net/search/label/Lean"
target="_blank">Lean</a> and
<a href="http://bit.ly/theKanbanBook" target="_blank">Kanban</a> competence
will come into good use.

### How?

We're moving. All five of us. We're brining a nanny from Sweden to stay
with us the first six months or so and then fix the childcare situation
when we have settled in there.

The Salvation Army have set us up with a house five minutes walk from
where we'll work.

We will be employed by the Salvation Army Indonesia as project officers
and hence get Indonesian salaries. Which I feel is great since that
forces us to be part of the Indonesian culture, live like them, eat
their food, shop in their shops and do Indonesian stuff all around.

### Are you stupid?

I'm writing a book. I have a career that is bringing me to awesome
assignments and I work for
<a href="http://www.aptitud.se/" target="_blank">Aptitud</a> (that's
both a great bunch of guys and a very cool company that will rock the
contracting world of Stockholm... for starters). I play in
<a href="http://www.vasaband.se/" target="_blank">Vasa Band</a> at the
height of that bands history, both musically and spiritually. The Vasa
Corps, my church, is the best place I've been to and I love to go there.
I have great friends and a fantastic family around me.

I know all this. Just this autumn <a
href="https://www.marcusoft.net/2012/10/dear-marcus-theres-no-but-to-follow.html"
target="_blank">I wrote this post</a> that underlines all this. And
still we have decided to go.

There's never a great time to leave everything (for a couple of years),
but this time is not worse that others. Also - I firmly believe that God
will look after not only us, but you too. Yes, even you that doesn't
believe in Him (He believes in you, you see...). We're taking a step in
faith and trust that this will come out ok on all parts.

Career-wise this might not be the best move. But I'm sure that will be
ok too. The IT-scene in those part of the world is awesome, I'm told.
Maybe they haven't heard about kanban. I'll might be able to sell a copy
of <a href="http://bit.ly/theKanbanBook" target="_blank">Kanban In
Action</a> or give a talk or two.

### Have you thought about X?

No. I'm pretty sure we haven't. You cannot go on a trip like this and
expect that you will know everything before you leave. So we have nailed
the big ones:

- We know where we will be staying
- We know that we'll have work
- We know that the kids are taken care of
- We know that we'll be part of a Salvation Army Corps in Bandung

We're looking into:

- Subletting our apartment
- Where to store our stuff during our stay (the Salvation Army will
    help us)

If you think we have missed any major things please let me know. If you
think of a lot of details - keep them to yourselves. We have A LOT of
details in our head daily. And most of them is not crucial for leaving
or not, once you think hard about it.

### Will you still be around?

You can reach me on <a href="http://twitter.com/marcusofnet"
target="_blank">@marcusoftnet</a> on twitter, marcusoftnet as my gmail
account too and marcushammarberg at Skype.

We're hoping to set up another blog with photos and stuff as we land.
Now I need to plan, pack and finish the book.
