<p>I have <a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2008/12/soap-ui-great-way-to-do-integration.html" target="_blank">already blogged</a> about <a href="http://www.soapui.org/" target="_blank">SOAPUi</a> but then it was more me thinking and seeing it was a good idea to use SOAPUi to do testing of service. </p>  <p>Now I have actually done this – and I love it so far. In the last project where we our deliverable was a service I think we spent about 30% of our time creating and maintaining the test client. </p>  <p>Not to speak about all the time we had to spend explaining for the client that “no this is NOT the GUI you will see later on”.</p>  <p>So the thought of a general test client for SOAP services is very compelling. And <a href="http://www.soapui.org" target="_blank">SOAPUi</a> has done a great job making your job easy and fun… Almost all of the time. </p>  <p>They have an amazing <a href="http://www.soapui.org/userguide/index.html" target="_blank">amount of documentation</a>. I guarantee that everything I am about to tell you is in there somewhere… This is my short story for our case.</p>  <p>So the case is as follows – I have a quite simple WCF service. One trick is that we need to call a common security service (let’s call it SECI) to get a token that we have pass into our operations.</p>  <p>We have worked contract first and started with a WSDL-file. I used <a href="http://wscfblue.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">WSCF.blue</a> (great tool) to generate the service stub. And then…</p>  <ul>   <li>I <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/soapui/files/soapui/3.5" target="_blank">downloaded SOAPUi</a>. Go on - do it now- it’s free!</li>    <li>I created a <a href="http://www.soapui.org/userguide/projects/images/new_wsdl_project.gif" target="_blank">new project</a> by pointing the wizard to my WSDL-file. I also asked the tool to create a starter testcase for me.       <br />Beware of the location or endpoint address – it’s read from the WSDL-file and most likely you will need to change that to your computer or the server where your service is deployed.</li>    <li>I then added a new WSDL to the SECI service to the project. This is needed to be able to call</li> </ul>  <p>I was now ready to create my test case with the test steps I need to call the SECI service and insert the token into the request I wanted to test. </p>  <ul>   <li>First I created some parameters for my test suite. This is actually hidden away a bit.</li>    <ul>     <li>Open the test suite editor by right clicking it and chose “Show TestSuite Editor”</li>      <li>In the lower section of the editor you’ll find a “tab” that is named Properties</li>      <li>Here you can add properties that will be visible for the whole test suite</li>      <li>I added some inparameters to the SECI service and the token I will pass on</li>   </ul>    <li>I then called the SECI service, passing it values from the parameters I created in the earlier step. </li>    <li>To get the values from the response of the SECI service into the request to my service I used a <a href="http://www.soapui.org/userguide/functional/propertytransfers.html" target="_blank">Property Transfer</a>. In it I transferred the value of the token node into a variable that holds the property for the token.      <br />It’s a quite deep structure with dropdown boxes and namespaces in the UI here but it’s not to hard to understand.</li>    <li>Finally I could easily insert the value of the token variable into my request, as before.</li> </ul>  <p>It wasn’t to hard after I got understanding about the variables for the testsuite. I sure beats having to code your test client manually…</p>  <p>Great work SOAPUi!</p>
