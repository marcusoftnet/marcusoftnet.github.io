Microsoft has just released a game-development studio which looks
very nice. And finally even I has do some game-development. A real cool
feature (except the real easy programming model) is that the games that
you create can be run on Xbox 360.

This will be a cool way to introduce programming for young people or
just highlight some concepts in traditional (i.e. "boring" programming)
via gaming. I know I'll try anyway.

Thanks HÃ¥kan for the tip
