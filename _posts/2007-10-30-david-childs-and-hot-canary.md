A
few weeks back the British National Brass Band Championship took place
with Grimethorpe as winners for the second
year running.

As always there was a short interlude-concert before the results was
announced, this year with Black Dyke Band. One of the featured soloist
was David Childs and his performance of Hot
Canary just blew my mind! That dude really has control - not a slip, not
a hint of bad intonation AND having fun. Thank you!

For the next week the performance is on the last weeks [Listen to the
band](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/aod/networks/radio2/aod.shtml?radio2/listenband).
