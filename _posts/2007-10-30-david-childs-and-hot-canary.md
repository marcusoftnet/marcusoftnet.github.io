A
few weeks back the British National Brass Band Championship took place
with <span>="blsp-spelling-error">Grimethorpe</span> as winners for the second
year running.

As always there was a short interlude-concert before the results was
announced, this year with Black Dyke Band. One of the featured soloist
was David <span>="blsp-spelling-error">Childs</span> and his performance of Hot
Canary just blew my mind! That dude really has control - not a slip, not
a hint of bad intonation AND having fun. Thank you!

For the next week the performance is on the last weeks [Listen to the
band](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/aod/networks/radio2/aod.shtml?radio2/listenband).
