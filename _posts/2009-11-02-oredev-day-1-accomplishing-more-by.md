I am at my first conference since 2000. My good times flies, then it was
.NET launch and I was very envious of the people getting to try it out
since I was stuck in a never ending VB6 Com+ assignment. Well, here we
are - 2009 and [ÖreDev](http://www.oredev.org/).

The first day for me was spent with a single session that took the whole
day. I didn't know to much about it and simple went to it since the
title was so alluring - [Accomplishing more by doing
less](http://accomplishingmorebydoingless.com/), with [Marc
Lesser](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUqL2p94XMc) (taken name?). Who
can miss out on such a offering.

Well, as expected I guess, the content wasn't so much on thing to do,
that would only have added to the burden of things to do. But rather it
was about doing less of some thing, namely:

</div>

<div>

-   **Fear** - here we talked a lot about why we fear stuff like time,
    not being seen etc. Also the antidote is to be generous which I
    think sounds very nice. Being generous with your attention, your joy
    etc.
-   **Assumptions** - we stopped for a while and pondered the false
    assumptions that we often bring to a situation. Also we did an
    excellent exercise in which we looped and dipped. looping is simple
    retell a story and see how it was received / interpreted. Dipping is
    talking about your emotions surrounding the story and story telling.
-   **Distractions** - how many thing that distracts us. Especially in
    the social media tsunami of today. We learned that successful people
    have their priorities in order and act on them. Be present and
    reduce your Work In Progress was other lessons learned. I mentioned
    Pomodoro as a great technique to manage distractions.
-   **Resistance** - actually we didn't get into this one at all…
-   **Busyness** - we all want to look busy. But why? A thought was
    thrown out that it had to do with fear of life being short. If we
    are busy we think that we get the most out of it… But we would be
    wrong - we don't have time to see that life is passing…

The lecture was Marc Lesser and he brought a real calmness and ease to
the session. Starting with 30 minutes meditation will maybe do that.

Although I, as a Christian, don't agree on everything surrounding the
spiritual part of Zen - I still got a lot out of the session. I of
course cannot describe all of it here - but I will take with me to start
to be more present and be generous with my attention.

Thank you Marc, for a great day.
