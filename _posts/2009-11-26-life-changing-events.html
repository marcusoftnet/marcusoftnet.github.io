<p>Often you can’t see them until afterwards… the events that really changed the course of your life. But in retrospect you can almost always point a single point in time when your life took a certain path. </p>  <p>Yesterday wasn’t one of those event. I know exactly when it happened. 15:12 2009-11-25. </p>  <p>We are going to have a second child. So we went to the ultrasound examination to see that everything was in order. And it was. </p>  <blockquote>   <p>The nurse:  He is the divider-wall (sorry but the non-techie English).  <br />Me (thinking): I never heard about no divider-wall when Albert was in there.   <br />Nurse: And here is the first fetus.   <br />Me: Ok… the first one. Nice…. What! First one!</p> </blockquote>  <p>After that the nurse had to leave us. Two takes longer than one. So I told Elin; that just now, that was a life changing event. </p>  <p>So we’re going to have TWINS! In April!  </p><p><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_TI0jeIedRFk/Sw4nZppeWdI/AAAAAAAAAKY/9Qn1DMFJMWY/s1600/IMG_0054.JPG"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_TI0jeIedRFk/Sw4nZppeWdI/AAAAAAAAAKY/9Qn1DMFJMWY/s320/IMG_0054.JPG" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5408303524148566482" /></a></p>  <p>It’s still very new and a bit hard to get used to, but it will hopefully sink in soon. I still have some trouble seeing myself as a dad – now I’m gonna be a big-family-guy/dad.</p>  <p>Right now we’re tossed between extreme happiness and strong bewilderment. Mostly happy. </p>
