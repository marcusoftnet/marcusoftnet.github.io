Tomorrow is another sprint demo. I love the fast-forward way of
incrementing doing improvements that SCRUM offers.
One of the features i really like is the way that the developers get to
feel good about themselves and to be proud.
Really builds team spirit.

If you haven't tried SCRUM out yet - do it already. It's dead simple to
get started and will give you results (faster, <span

deliveries, better team spirit, happier customers) right away.
