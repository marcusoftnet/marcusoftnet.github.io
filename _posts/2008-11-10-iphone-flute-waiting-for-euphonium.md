OK - this might be the coolest "useless" application I've seen... but it alone made me want an iPhone. Badly.

And here:

The cool thing is that Apple has created such a great mobile computing platform. Telephony is just an application among others, such as the flute.

I am still waiting for the euphonium, of course...
