Found this article on [Agile Software
Development](http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/newMethodology.html)
and it made me realize two thing that humbled me:

-   I haven't done to much of Agile development. And reading this
    article makes me sad... This thoughts that agile development base
    the whole development process on is solution to many of the problems
    that i have encountered in different projects.
   I have even said and been the guys that mr Folwer talks about as
    "the old, bureaucratic engineering" developers. Brrr - sends shivers
    down my spine when i think about it :)
-   The .NET community is a bit behind... or in any case can only
    harvest the good ideas invented by the Java-community. This article
    is written 2000! And! in it he talks about these methodologies as
    they have been around for some year.

But then again - isn't this what it is all about. Get some new idea, try
it out, adapt it for your needs and use it. Or put shorter "Steal with
pride" as a mentor to me often said.

The article in any case made me decide to go in a more agile way in the
next project.
