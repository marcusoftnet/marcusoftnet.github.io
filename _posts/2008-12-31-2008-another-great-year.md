To sum up 2008 is not very hard for me—it starts and ends with Abbe (Albert). He was almost a part of our lives at the start of 2008 since he took up considerable space in Elin's belly. :)

In work, I don't think I ever learned so much in one year (TFS, SOA, MSBuild, WCF, Oracle, just to mention a few things I have touched during the year). But it came at a cost—I lost my ability to leave work at work when I go home. I'll try to improve that next year, which won't be hard since I will be home with Abbe for about six months.

With the [Vasa Band](http://www.vasaband.se), it was also a great year with the recording and release of our CD [Priority](http://www.vasaband.se/wm07.php) and a tour of the western parts of Sweden. On top of that, we did two great Christmas concerts at the beginning of December. It is a great band with a focus on Jesus and bringing a message through our music. I just love to play with the band—in many regards, the best band I've ever played with.

For the Salvation Army part of "me," my corps has rebuilt, moved out, and back again into our new, wonderful hall. A great feat for a corps that consists of people doing stuff in their spare time. But it also took its toll—it was quite hard work at times...

So that was a great 2008—let's make 2009 even better.
