To sum up 2008 is not very hard for me - it starts and ends with Abbe
(Albert). He was almost a part of our lives at the start of 2008 since
he took up considerable space in Elin's belly. :)

He went from:

In work I don't think I ever learned so much in one year (TFS, SOA,
MSBuild, WCF, Oracle just to mention a few things I have touched during
the year). But it come to a cost - where I also lost my ability to leave
work at work when I go home.
I'll try to improve that next year - which won't be hard since I will be
home with Abbe for about six months.

With the [Vasa Band](http://www.vasaband.se) it was also a great year
with the recording and release of our CD
[Priority](http://www.vasaband.se/wm07.php) and a tour of the western
parts of Sweden. On top of that we did two great Christmas concerts in
the begriming of December. It is a great band with focus on Jesus and
bringing a message through our music. I just love to play with the
band - in many regards the best band I've ever played with.

For the Salvation Army part of "me" - my corps has rebuilt and move out
and back again into our new, wonderful hall. A great feat for a corps
that just consists of people doing stuff on their spare time. But it
also took it's toll - it was quite hard work at times...

So that was a great 2008 - let's do 2009 even better.
