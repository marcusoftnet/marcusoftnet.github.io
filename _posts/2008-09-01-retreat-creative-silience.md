I am
back from a very different weekend indeed. I was given the opportunity
to take part in a retreat organised by our corps (congregation). That
meant that we were 15 people going away to far-off place and were silent
for the main part of the weekend.

Yes - i understand that the ones who know me have a very hard time to
see me being silent for such a long time, but it all went very well.

Also the power and restfulness in being silent was so great. There are
so many experiences that will stay with me for a long, long time; like
eating together with 15 people in total silence - very different, or
walking together with two close friends, without saying anything - it
made me feel powerful.

Finally - when you are left "alone" with such much time on your hands it
was very interesting to see which needs or feelings that should surface.
For me, i am glad to say, I discovered that Jesus, the bible and just
being in the nature was very important.

I said in the beginning that "I was given the opportunity" - which means
that there must be a *giver...* For me it's very clear that this is God
giving me this - I just wanted to say Thank you!
