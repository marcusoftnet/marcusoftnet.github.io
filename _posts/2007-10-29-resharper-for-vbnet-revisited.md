Ok -
i'll give
Resharper
another try - thanks to Ilya Ryzhenkov who <span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_5" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">encouraged
me to try again. In all honesty the crasches i experienced were all in a
buildscript-file, XML-syntax.

So i'll
have to try it with pure VB.NET-code i expect... Here we go.
