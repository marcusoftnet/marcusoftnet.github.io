The last week has really been something extra. Last Friday, early morning, we got some signs that the [twins](https://www.marcusoft.net/2009/11/life-changing-events.html) were on their way.

And 11 hours later, they had arrived.

Since then, Gustav (twin 2) has been sick. The short story is that being born too early, his lungs had not developed fully. But he's getting better and is on his way to a full recovery. We’re hoping to be back home with the twins at the beginning of next week.

Arvid (twin 1, born about 30 minutes earlier) is a very calm and peaceful person so far. Gustav has a bit more temper, but they are both quite easy-going. Gustav looks a lot like me, and Arvid is a bit thinner in his looks.

I thought I'd post some pictures of them. Here you go:

For people reading this blog searching for IT-stuff, I’ll be back on that track soon. Other stuff seems so much more important right now, like children.
