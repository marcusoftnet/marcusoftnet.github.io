Also - I am now entering one of the more hectic periods of my life (with two free days for the next four weeks, if I remember correctly) so the blogging will probably stand back for a while. But I'll keep you all posted.

The things I am going to do during this time include (strange combination, I must say):

- Playing solo at a concert with [SolnaBrass](http://www.solnabrass.com/)
- parting new assignment within my work
- and ending the previous one
- Presenting talk about SCRUM in front of hundreds (brrrr)
- Presenting two concerts with [Gothenburg Brass Band](http://www.goteborgbrassband.org.se/)
- ing host at the get-together after Bengt Eklund's funeral
- Standard playing with the Salvation Army at Vasa

Well - interesting times are ahead. I am sure it will be fun... also
