Also - i am now entering one of the more hectic periods of my life
(with two free days for the next four weeks, if i remember correctly) so
the blogging will probably stand back for a while. But I'll keep you all
posted.

The things i am going to do during this time include (strange
combination, i must say):

-   playing solo at a concert with
    [SolnaBrass](http://www.solnabrass.com/)
-   starting new assignment within my work
-   ... and ending the previous one
-   doing talk about SCRUM in front of hundreds (brrrr)
-   presenting two concerts with [Gothenburg Brass
    Band](http://www.goteborgbrassband.org.se/)
-   being host at the get-together after Bengt Eklunds funeral
-   standard playing with the Salvation Army at Vasa

Well - interesting times are ahead. I am sure it will be fun... also
