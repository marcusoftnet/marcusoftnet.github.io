Also - I am now entering one of the more hectic periods of my life
(with two free days for the next four weeks, if I remember correctly) so
the blogging will probably stand back for a while. But I'll keep you all
posted.

The things I am going to do during this time include (strange
combination, I must say):

- aying solo at a concert with
  [SolnaBrass](http://www.solnabrass.com/)
- arting new assignment within my work
- . and ending the previous one
- ing talk about SCRUM in front of hundreds (brrrr)
- esenting two concerts with [Gothenburg Brass
  Band](http://www.goteborgbrassband.org.se/)
- ing host at the get-together after Bengt Eklunds funeral
- andard playing with the Salvation Army at Vasa

Well - interesting times are ahead. I am sure it will be fun... also
