Here are a picture from the caroling in the Old Town of Stockholm, which i've mentioned. It was quite dark but that how it is in Sweden these days, and yes - we don't have any snow. To much work with the shovel so we just removed it once for all :) We're all "dreaming of a green Christmas, just like the ones from 2006"
