As [I wrote earlier](http://www.marcusoft.net/2008/06/new-modeljob.html)
I have done another "photo session" for [Avega](http://www.avega.se/). Who
knew that such assignments were to take place at a software consultant
firm ;).

I then promised to show the result and here it is.

I am really pleased with the result. It almost looks like it was drawn
or something. Really cool colors. It is a great photographer. The model
leaves more to wish for but you'll have to work with what you've got...
