I've just returned from a tour with my Salvation Army Band - the
Vasa
Band. What a great group of people.

We have had an amazing weekend with lots of fun, great fellowship and
some really nice music making. The band makes me so proud - there are
only we, we're nothing special but together we make it special.

To see two twelve year olds playing their hearts out on the
last bar of a big piece, or to hear great and insightful presentations
from a lot of members, ranging from 16 to sixty years, or to take part
in the prayers before and after the festivals - that makes me so
proud!

What a band - thank you guys for a great weekend - lets make many
more...
