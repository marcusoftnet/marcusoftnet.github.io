[This service](http://www.en.conv2pdf.com/) is really great when you get
one of those files that you don't know how or have the program to read.
In my case it was a .pub file (Microsoft Publisher).

Now you don't have to download any readers... And for up to 6 MB it's
free.

It's been done! It's solved! I don't know how but it is...
