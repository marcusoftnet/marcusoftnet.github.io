OK, my
guessing from last week blew up... Dyke didn't make it three in a row by
the narrowest margin as they ended up in second place. It also had to
sting a bit extra since Cory (who won) are conducted by Robert Childs
brother of Nicholas Childs who conducts Black Dyke.

Now we will never know how the organisers had intended to solve the gold
medal problem. It says in the rules (from the 185o's) that if a band
manages to win three times in a row the band cannot compete the
following year - AND should also be rewarded a gold medal! That would
have been something to see...

[4BarsRest](http://www.4barsrest.com/) really outdid themselves with
some [marvelous coverage of the
event](http://www.4barsrest.com/live/2007open/), with live photos even.
You could almost feel the tension through the site...

So - now the contesting for the season is open.
