Phew - the
last week has real been something else...

We are closing in on a demo (tomorrow) for my project and as always that
means wrapping things up. Which in turns means that you'll have to tend
to all the stuff that has been unattended for way to long.

Well, well - everything seems quite alright as it is now so i am not
that worried. Fingers crossed.
