The presentations on
<a href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2008/05/presentations.html"
target="_blank">Monday</a> went well.

The SOA-part of the presentation was even better than I first hoped. My
partner and I didn't have that much time to prepare or at least try it
out. But I thought that we got the message across.

For the euphonium part it was a shaky trip from bad to good. The theme
and the first variation was just awful - I counted six or seven errors.
Then I played the triplets and they went well ... better.

Before that night I've never nailed the last variation - it's so hard.
But all of a sudden it just flowed. I was very satisfied with that!

OK - now for the next thing. On Saturday I will be a presenter for the
Salvation Army during a big event for Stockholm Marathon. That will be
fun!
