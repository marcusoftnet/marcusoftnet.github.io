Yes, I know that some people will refer to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld"
target="_blank">Seinfeld</a> and the
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0697793/usercomments"
target="_blank">episode</a> where George go on a vacation when being
without a job, but it's true - my vacation starts tomorrow. What that
means is that I am going to
<a href="http://www.hitta.se/LargeMap.aspx?var=Hyppeln"
target="_blank">Hyppeln</a> on the west coast of Sweden. It will be
great and hopefully with some better weather than we have had the last
few weeks...

I learned something today that the Sunday morning service. It has been
quite a stressful week with loads of meeting in the calendar, big things
to ponder and surgery for Albert... And I got quite stressed out. When
that happens to me I can't really focus and so I get more stressed out
for things that I might miss. It's a viscous circle. Also it tend to
happen more and more frequently.

But the sermon today spoke almost directly to me; it was about Jesus as
our Lord, as \#1 in our life's. And a part of the scripture that was
read was <a
href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matt%206:33;&amp;version=31;"
target="_blank">Matthew 6:33</a>

> But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things
> will be given to you as well.

And I came to realize the power of the verse. It says that if you start
with God the rest will be solved. So when in situations when you don't
know how to prioritize or can't find time - start with God!

That will be my new mantra - Start with God! I will try to give God more
space in my schedule and start my days with God. Not end them with him
as I do now, when I almost pass out of tiredness. If no other reason so
just to have him with me in all the other things that I do and that it
will make me cope with "all these things".

Try it - you will find that the other things "will be given to you as
well".

Happy summer!
