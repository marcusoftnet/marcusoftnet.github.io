Yes, I know that some people will refer to [Seinfeld](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld) and the [episode](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0697793/usercomments) where George goes on vacation while being without a job, but it's true—my vacation starts tomorrow. What that means is that I am going to [Hyppeln](http://www.hitta.se/LargeMap.aspx?var=Hyppeln) on the west coast of Sweden. It will be great and hopefully with some better weather than we have had the last few weeks...

I learned something today from the Sunday morning service. It has been quite a stressful week with loads of meetings, big things to ponder, and surgery for Albert... And I got quite stressed out. When that happens to me, I can't really focus, and so I get more stressed out about things that I might miss. It's a vicious circle. Also, it tends to happen more and more frequently.

But the sermon today spoke almost directly to me; it was about Jesus as our Lord, as Number 1 in our lives. A part of the scripture that was read was [Matthew 6:33](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matt%206:33;&version=31;):

> But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.

And I came to realize the power of the verse. It says that if you start with God, the rest will be solved. So, when in situations where you don't know how to prioritize or can't find time—start with God!

That will be my new mantra: Start with God! I will try to give God more space in my schedule and start my days with Him. Not end them with Him as I do now, when I am almost passing out from tiredness. If for no other reason, just to have Him with me in all the other things that I do and that it will help me cope with "all these things."

Try it—you will find that the other things "will be given to you as well."

Happy summer!
