##### The fallacy of efficiency

Dan North – given a talk on not believing in efficiency (the theme of
the conference) ;).

What he is aiming at is the difference in efficiency (the effort we
burnt so far) and effectiveness (the outcome is what’s important, not
how much we burnt so far).

OK – this is great! He is dropping gold ever ten seconds. I just hope to
get hold of the slides, and try to post them here. I cannot possible
summarize it here… It’s boarder-lining on politics but I like it.

<a href="http://dannorth.net/" target="_blank">Dan North</a> – check him
out. He’s great and quite funny also.

OK – best so far! By far!

##### Explorations of <a href="https://www.hibernate.org/343.html"
target="_blank">NHibernate</a>

This will be another talk by Stephen Bohlen, the <a
href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2009/11/oredev-day-2-nhibernate-in-practice.html"
target="_blank">speedtalker</a>… So I don’t expect to be able to write
to much during this.

We’re learning about add-ons (etc.) to NHibernate.

Here are some nuggets that I managed to throw down:

-   <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/rhino-tools/"
    target="_blank">Rhino Tools</a>
-   <a href="http://code.google.com/p/unhaddins/"
    target="_blank">uNhAddins</a>
-   <a
    href="http://www.codinginstinct.com/2008/05/nhibernate-validator.html"
    target="_blank">NHibernate Validator</a> (hey, first hit on Google
    to
    <a href="http://www.codinginstinct.com/" target="_blank">Torkel</a>).
    Here’s it using a <a
    href="http://brendanjerwin.github.com/2009/03/11/using-nhibernate-validator-with-fluent-nhibernate.html"
    target="_blank">fluent interface</a>
-   <a href="http://code.google.com/p/nhlambdaextensions/"
    target="_blank">NHLambdaExtensions</a>
-   <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/nhcontrib/develop"
    target="_blank">NHibernate Burrow</a> – business transactions
    (without hitting the database)
-   <a href="http://fluentnhibernate.org/" target="_blank">Fluent
    NHibernate</a>, which <a
    href="http://www.marcusoft.net/2009/09/automapping-with-fluentnhibernate.html"
    target="_blank">I praised already</a>
-   <a href="http://nhprof.com/" target="_blank">NHProfiler</a>
-   and finally <a href="http://code.google.com/p/hornget/"
    target="_blank">HornGet.NET</a>

This was great but oh so fast, I’m short of breath…

##### Productive WCF

Going into the last part of the day and I am beginning to feel tired…

OK – <a href="http://www.idesign.net/" target="_blank">Juval Löwy</a> is
up now and I expect some pretty advanced stuff.

Yep – I will be some not so well-know productiveness things in WCF.
Another list:

-   <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb552363.aspx"
    target="_blank">WCFServiceHost</a> a generic WCF host supplied with
    Visual Studio. Works great when debugging.
-   And a generic test client,
    <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb552364.aspx"
    target="_blank">WCFTestClient</a>. And this can be combined
    together. Great stuff!
-   Instrumentation for WCF can be applied with
    <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms735098.aspx"
    target="_blank">&lt;diagnostics performanceCounters=”all” /&gt;</a>
-   I already knew about the
    <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms732009.aspx"
    target="_blank">WCF Service Configuration Editor</a> in Visual
    Studio, but it’s a secret for many.
-   But I didn’t know about
    <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms732023.aspx"
    target="_blank">Microsoft Service Trace Viewer</a>
-   <a
    href="http://en.csharp-online.net/WCF_Essentials—Implementing_InProcFactory_T"
    target="_blank">InProcFactory</a> looks cool – you can actually
    create a WCF-service from any .NET-class, on the fly.

Another great session. I’m running out of batteries now. Not sure if I
can document the last session… Maybe – I’ll publish now, just for sure.

##### Accessing Data in the Azure Cloud

<a href="http://www.thedatafarm.com" target="_blank">Julia Lernman</a>
based her talk on the frustration on not understanding how to use it,
from a developer perspective. Suits me just fine – I’ll learn all the
cloud religion later… :)

This seems to be a great but basic talk. I’ll leave it and try to grasp
it. I am a beginner on this…
