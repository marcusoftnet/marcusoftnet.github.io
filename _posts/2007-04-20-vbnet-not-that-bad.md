Just for
the record i also need to add a small notice as an answer to [my
battering of
VB.NET](http://marcushammarberg.blogspot.com/2007/03/vbnet-or-c.html)....
It's not to bad actually.

I switched syntax in about a day and feel quite at home with it now. A
few things that is a bit strange for the kind of language that VB.NET is
(i.e. helpful and forgiving):

-   The refactor menu from Visual Studio 2005 is gone! Why is that? It
    so good... Well found a [freeware
    download](http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/IDETools/VBRefactor/)
    which i am using now. The GUI of that download is really cool, maybe
    a bit irritating after a while, even.
-   Namespaces are a bit troublesome. If you create a folder in your
    project and then add a class into it, the class still get the
    project default namespace. I've been doing some googeling about it
    but cannot find a solution to it...

But all in all i like it quite much for now.
