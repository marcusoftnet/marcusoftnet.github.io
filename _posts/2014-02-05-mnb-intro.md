I have been playing with [NodeJs](http://nodejs.org/) during the evenings. Really late onto that train, but here we are. In fact, this is just by coincidence; I happened to bring "[JavaScript - the good parts](http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742)" to [Indonesia](https://www.marcusoft.net/2013/06/moving-to-indonesia.html) and it was the only book I had. Once I had read that awesome book, I got invited to [write a review](https://www.marcusoft.net/2013/12/nancy-fx-now-you-can-read-her-too.html) for the [NancyFx book](http://www.packtpub.com/nancy-web-development/book) by Christian Horsdal and got a free book for my effort. I just picked one and it happened to be [Mastering Node.js](http://www.packtpub.com/mastering-nodejs/book).

After that book and my head had stopped spinning, we still had to wait for our belongings to arrive in Indonesia. I had nothing to read or code. So I thought I would put my Node-knowledge into action and started to check out [Express](http://expressjs.com/).

Here we are. I haven't really coded anything real, but rather read, labbed, and followed a lot of tutorials. But I've picked a couple of things that I've found very useful. I really don't know how to classify them, but maybe it could be called patterns, as in "ways I often end up working".

**BIG DISCLAIMER** - these are just my remember list. I'm getting old. I forget stuff. I write it here. I'm getting old. I forget ... no... wait... What I'm saying is that you shouldn't expect to be blown away by the depth and innovation here. But I can almost guarantee that you and I haven't thought about the same things. You might pick something interesting up.

This will be super long if I put everything into a single post. So I'll do many small posts instead. Here's the link list:

- [Doing stuff in the terminal is not scary at all](https://www.marcusoft.net/2014/02/mnb-terminal.html)
- [`npm` is not only for getting packages](https://www.marcusoft.net/2014/02/mnb-npm.html)
- [Package.json is a mighty tool](https://www.marcusoft.net/2014/02/mnb-packagejson.html)
- [`git` is not that hard, but I need to refresh my knowledge](https://www.marcusoft.net/2014/02/mnb-git.html)
- [Callback function is cool stuff, and I even know how to write them](https://www.marcusoft.net/2014/02/mnb-callbacks.html)
- [`mocha` is cool both as framework and test runner](https://www.marcusoft.net/2014/02/mnb-mocha.html)
- [`should` is a nice way to do asserts](https://www.marcusoft.net/2014/02/mnb-should.html)
- [`monk` is an easy way to access mongo](https://www.marcusoft.net/2014/02/mnb-monk.html)
- [Express is best without generators](https://www.marcusoft.net/2014/02/mnb-express.html)
- [supertest is a nice way to test an api](https://www.marcusoft.net/2014/02/mnb-supertest.html)

I'm also planning to write a "putting it all together" post where I create a little back-end API for a small site using the "patterns" I've written about.

I've learned a lot from different sources, but one that I keep coming back to is the excellent writings of [Azat Mardanov](https://twitter.com/azat_co) on his blog [http://www.webapplog.com/](http://www.webapplog.com/). Thank you sir!

The [Node course at TekPub](http://tekpub.com/products/node) is awesome too and be sure to check it out.
