I found a feature that I thought was a bug in Visual Studio... If you have [ReSharper](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/) (4.0 in my case) installed it shows your missing references directly in the .config-file.

![Missing references showing with ReSharper](http://lh3.ggpht.com/_kkDJOSPNTLs/SQ8MOh9127I/AAAAAAAAAYI/-SxwFY8XlyE/s1600-h/config%5B9%5D.jpg)

Of course, there are limitations to this - secondary references cannot be resolved, but it is still a great help. Unfortunately, it confused me for a while, thinking it was a bug in the config editor of Visual Studio. But I take that one on me.
