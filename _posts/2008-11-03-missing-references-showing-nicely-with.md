I found a feature that I thought was bug in Visual Studio... If you have
<a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/"
target="_blank">ReSharper</a> (4.0 in my case) installed it shows your
missing references directly in the .config-file.

Of course there are limitations of this - secondary references cannot be
resolved but it is still a great help. Unfortunately it confused me for
a while thinking it was a bug in the config editor of Visual Studio. But
I take that one on me.
