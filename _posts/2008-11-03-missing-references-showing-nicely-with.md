I found a feature that I thought was a bug in Visual Studio... If you have [ReSharper](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/) (4.0 in my case) installed, it shows your missing references directly in the .config file.

Of course, there are limitations to thisâ€”secondary references cannot be resolved, but it is still a great help. Unfortunately, it confused me for a while, thinking it was a bug in the config editor of Visual Studio. But I take that one on me.
