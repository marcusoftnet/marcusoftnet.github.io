Last week [Miriam](http://marcushammarberg.blogspot.com/2007/08/morning-devotional-by-friend-of-mine.html) did it again. She held, all of her own, the weekend-evening devotional (well I am not sure of the word for helgmålsbön, but that will have too do...).

Again she did it with a most visible easy and some very interesting thoughts. "God is bothering me..." who'll ever knew that that would be the theme for one of those shows.

Well - if you missed it, it's about ten minutes of sharp-edge thinking. And you can [see it again here](http://www.svt.se/svt/jsp/Crosslink.jsp?d=69758) Se programmen I SVT Play and choose the 15 sept show).

Way to go Miriam - you are honoring our prayer group on your mission trip to Norrland ;)
