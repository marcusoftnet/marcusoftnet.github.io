Last week [Miriam](http://marcushammarberg.blogspot.com/2007/08/morning-devotional-by-friend-of-mine.html)
did it again. She held, all of her own, the weekend-evening devotional
(well i am not sure of the word for helgmålsbön, but that will have too
do...).

Again she did it with a most visible easy and some very interesting
thoughts. "God is bothering me..." who'll ever knew that that would be
the theme for one of those shows.

Well - if you missed it, it's about ten minutes of sharp-edge thinking.
And you can [see it again
