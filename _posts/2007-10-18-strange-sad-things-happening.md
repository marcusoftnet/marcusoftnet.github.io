The last few weeks there have been a lot of really strange and sad
things happening in my network of friends and relatives. There have been
deaths, suicidals, people nearly dying,
relationships ending and several friends with some pretty
serious problems to handle.

At the same time i feel like i am on the right place and at the right
time in life. I experience the best project and
learning experience of my life at work, i love the band and my corps and
most of all Elin and I have never had it
better.

Why is this? It feels really strange to still feel ... not happy but
strong, maybe. I can only take it as a blessing from God and that i hope
that i can be of support to anyone who needs me. I cannot count the
number of times it's been the other way around.

My thoughts and prayers goes out to all the people who i have been in
contact with surrounding these things the last
couple of weeks.
