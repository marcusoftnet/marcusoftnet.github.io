Got a tip from [Daniel](http://www.numlock.se) about this video, that shows an easy way to learn and understand [JQuery](http://www.jquery.com):

With this and [Selenium](http://seleniumhq.org/) I cannot stand back anymore â€“ I need to install [FireFox](http://www.mozilla.com/) for the first time.
