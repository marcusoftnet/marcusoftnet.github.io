Oh - how i
love to be right...

A few months back I was very upset about the [ban of
mobiles-phones](https://www.marcusoft.net/2007/01/mobilephones-forbidden-on-subway-in.html)
on the subway and buses in Stockholm.

In that post I also wrote that we would laugh ("No really, I promise.
For a while the subway had banned mobile phones...") about that a year
from then... Today we took the first step to the laughs since [SL has
revoked the
prohibition.](http://www.sl.se/Templates/Article.aspx?id=5245)

It surely was one of the dumbest... no I think you get what I mean
