This tool, [MSBuild Sidekick](http://www.attrice.info/msbuild/), looks quite promising. It's a graphical editor with which you build MSBuild project files.

I am always quite skeptical of tools that let you "draw code" that you can easily write yourself. But this tool seems to hold some very [useful](http://www.attrice.info/images/msbuild/sideckik_target_diagram.gif) [features](http://www.attrice.info/images/msbuild/sidekick_w_addTask_dialog.gif). I'll try to experiment with it when I get the chance.
