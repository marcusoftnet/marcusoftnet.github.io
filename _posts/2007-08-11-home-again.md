<div>

I am home again after four weeks vacation. Feels great and i am really
in the mood to get down and do some programming again, and playing, and
all the other stuff that i normally do.

<div>

The vacation has been filled with wonderful sights (pictures from
Croatia included above) and experiences. But, as it always do, you long
for home in the end - and that is a good thing right? I mean that means
that you like your home the best of the places you been so far - good
for me. :)

<div>

The news i promised in an earlier post is that we are going to have a
baby!

</div>



<div>

<div>

This has already turned much of my world upside down - and the baby is
still five months away... I promise some more facts and my thoughts on
parenthood etc. in posts to follow. For now we are just very happy!

</div>

<div>

And no - we don't know the kind (boy/girl) yet.

</div>



<div>

And yes - there are a lot of twins in the family. High ... risk/chance
take your pick :)
