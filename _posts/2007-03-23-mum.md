This
week has been a bit upside down in a already hectic period. My mum had a
TIA (?) which is <span>="blsp-spelling-corrected">hospital</span>-lingo for stopper in the
brain (sorry 'bout the <span>="blsp-spelling-corrected">English</span>).

Of course a lot of <span>="blsp-spelling-corrected">thoughts</span> runs through your mind
when something like that happens and it takes it toll on you mentally
and physically.

But it all seems to go well now and there are not <span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_3" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">lasting</span>
problems. Hopefully something good can come out of this and she can
reduce the stressing workload that she carries at work.
