This
week has been a bit upside down in a already hectic period. My mum had a
TIA (?) which is hospital-lingo for stopper in the
brain (sorry 'bout the English).

Of course a lot of thoughts runs through your mind
when something like that happens and it takes it toll on you mentally
and physically.

But it all seems to go well now and there are not lasting
problems. Hopefully something good can come out of this and she can
reduce the stressing workload that she carries at work.
