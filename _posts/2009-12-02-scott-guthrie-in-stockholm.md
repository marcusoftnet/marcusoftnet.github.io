I’ve been attending a full day of presentations by
<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/" target="_blank">Scott
Guthrie</a>, who seems to be involved in most things interesting at
Microsoft. The output from this guy is just amazing; blogging, products,
teams and thoughts… A lot.

I really looked forward to hearing him live and specifically what he had
to say about
<a href="http://www.asp.net/(S(m4vhrxrb1md4rg451u0b1445))/mvc/"
target="_blank">ASP.NET MVC 2</a>.

It was all good – even though the tempo in the presentation was
breakneck speed. Many of the new technologies from Microsoft nowadays
aims to be extensible and possible to tweek to your preferences.

From <a href="http://www.asp.net/mVC/" target="_blank">ASP.NET MVC</a> 2
I especially like

-   The
    <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd470179(VS.100).aspx"
    target="_blank">xxxFor HTML-helper</a> methods
-   The
    <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee402949(VS.100).aspx"
    target="_blank">EditorFor</a> helper methods
-   <a
    href="http://odetocode.com/Blogs/scott/archive/2009/10/13/asp-net-mvc2-preview-2-areas-and-routes.aspx"
    target="_blank">Areas</a> (which I understood for the first time
    during this presentation, thank you Scott).

I’m now enjoying his presentation on
<a href="http://silverlight.net/getstarted/silverlight-4-beta/"
target="_blank">Silverlight 4</a>, which will be my introduction to
Silverlight…

This was a great day that learned me a lot and also made me realize what
I don’t know… A lot…
