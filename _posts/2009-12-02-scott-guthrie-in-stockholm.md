I’ve been attending a full day of presentations by [Scott Guthrie](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/), who seems to be involved in most things interesting at Microsoft. The output from this guy is just amazing; blogging, products, teams, and thoughts… A lot.

I really looked forward to hearing him live and specifically what he had to say about [ASP.NET MVC 2](http://www.asp.net/(S(m4vhrxrb1md4rg451u0b1445))/mvc/).

It was all good – even though the tempo in the presentation was breakneck speed. Many of the new technologies from Microsoft nowadays aim to be extensible and possible to tweak to your preferences.

From [ASP.NET MVC 2](http://www.asp.net/mVC/) I especially like:

- The [xxxFor HTML-helper](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd470179(VS.100).aspx) methods
- The [EditorFor](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee402949(VS.100).aspx) helper methods
- [Areas](http://odetocode.com/Blogs/scott/archive/2009/10/13/asp-net-mvc2-preview-2-areas-and-routes.aspx) (which I understood for the first time during this presentation, thank you Scott).

I’m now enjoying his presentation on [Silverlight 4](http://silverlight.net/getstarted/silverlight-4-beta/), which will be my introduction to Silverlight…

This was a great day that taught me a lot and also made me realize what I don’t know… A lot…
