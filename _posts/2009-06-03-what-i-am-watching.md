Ok – the updates on this blog have been way under par for a while. That’s because I am not working right now.

I’ve noticed that when you have a lot of things to do, it’s easy to get the little things done in a jiffy, but when you do nothing, it’s hard to start even the small things… Strange but true.

OK – here are some things that I watch and enjoy right now.

[Shaun the Sheep](http://svtplay.se/t/108522/faret_shaun) – on [SvtPlay](http://svtplay.se/). Great fun for both me and Albert.

A complete live concert with [Black Dyke Band](http://blackdykeband.co.uk/) (part [1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lNaYGaeRFQ) and [2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LECAbPrQe0o)). The playing has some minor blemishes, but overall it’s great as usual, especially the Immortal-piece at the end!

Anything with [Fodens](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_type=&search_query=fodens+brass+band&aq=0&oq=fodens) on YouTube. Check out their run through Paganini variations (part [1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=271YkQ1vEoI) and [2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x19c_YPdODQ)).

And the rest of the time, I enjoy the company and lazy days with Elin and Albert. And yeah, I do Salvation Army work. Preparing for a camp this summer amongst other things.
