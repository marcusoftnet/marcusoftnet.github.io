Ok – the updates on this blog has been way under par for a while. That’s
because I am not working right now.

I’ve noticed that when you have a lot of things to do it’s easy to get
the little things done in a jiffy but when you do nothing it’s hard to
start to even the small things… Strange but true.

OK – here are some things that I watch and enjoy right now.

<a href="http://svtplay.se/t/108522/faret_shaun" target="_blank">Shaun
the sheep</a> – on
<a href="http://svtplay.se/" target="_blank">SvtPlay</a>.  Great fun for
both me and Albert.

A complete live concert with
<a href="http://blackdykeband.co.uk/" target="_blank">Black Dyke
Band</a> (part <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lNaYGaeRFQ"
target="_blank">1</a> and
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LECAbPrQe0o"
target="_blank">2</a>). The playing has some minor blemishes but overall
it’s great as usual, especially the Immortal-piece at the end!

Anything with <a
href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_type=&amp;search_query=fodens+brass+band&amp;aq=0&amp;oq=fodens"
target="_blank">Fodens</a> on YouTube. Check out their run through
Paganini variations (part
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=271YkQ1vEoI"
target="_blank">1</a> and
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x19c_YPdODQ"
target="_blank">2</a>).

And the rest of the time I enjoy the company and lazy days with Elin and
Albert. And yeah, I do Salvation Army work. Preparing for a camp this
summer amongst other things.
