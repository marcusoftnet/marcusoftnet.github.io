The second part of the weekend - Saturday and Sunday, I spent with the
[Windcorp
Brass Band](http://www.windcorpbrassband.se/). It can without any doubt
say that they are the best band in Sweden right now. Oh goodness - the
play well.

And they are all very nice people also. I felt right at home. Thank you
guys!

With the risk of being self-admiring now (brrr - hope not) I also love the
feeling of going in to present a very good concert (and band) to a full
hall. I didn't feel at all nervous although the hall was filled with 600
persons waiting to be entertained. But then again I always have my
little trick - I bring God with me on the stage. Otherwise I would be
very, very nervous. Try a prayer the next time you have to do something
scary - he has never let me down.

How funny it is that slip ups that I make always comes off as "bits" or
jokes. After the concert yesterday two people came up to me and thanked
me for some funny "bits". These bits were both slip ups from me where i
said something wrong - well thank you for not noticing.

But finally thank you [Windcorp Brass
Band](http://www.windcorpbrassband.se/) for a great weekend. I enjoyed
every moment of it! I'll add some pictures from the weekend when I remember my
camera
