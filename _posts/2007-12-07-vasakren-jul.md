Tonight is the night!

My corps is putting on our yearly Christmas Concert. This year I have
been in charge for the planning of it and I am quite nervous. Also the
program up to this and this weekend has been almost to much to handle.

But I am really looking forward to the concert tonight - it will be
great. KarlMagnus Fredriksson is
our guest soloist and that will surely be great. Vasa Gospel is
in kick-... form. And the band also sounds great. To top the whole thing
off we have our youth gospel choir - Vasas Granater that will be nice addition
to the whole scene.

This will be great.

The rest of the weekend will also be fun as I am presenter at the [WindCorp Brass
band](http://www.windcorpbrassband.se/) Christmas concerts.
