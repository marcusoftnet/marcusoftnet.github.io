Found [this cool tool](https://clipmon32.bountysource.com/) that <span
id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">remembers</span> a
list of things that you have copied onto your Clipboard. You can then
<span>="blsp-spelling-corrected">easily</span> pick among the items and
paste back things you have copied a while ago.

Invaluable for coders I guarantee; how often haven't you want to get the
second latest thing you paste? With
[Clipboard.NET](https://clipmon32.bountysource.com/) you can.

Great tool! You can download it from
[here](https://clipmon32.bountysource.com/downloads).
