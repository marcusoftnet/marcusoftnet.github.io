Found [this cool tool](https://clipmon32.bountysource.com/) that remembers a
list of things that you have copied onto your Clipboard. You can then
easily pick among the items and
paste back things you have copied a while ago.

Invaluable for coders I guarantee; how often haven't you want to get the
second latest thing you paste? With
[Clipboard.NET](https://clipmon32.bountysource.com/) you can.

Great tool! You can download it from
[here](https://clipmon32.bountysource.com/downloads).
