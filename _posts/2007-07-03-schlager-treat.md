I had missed this: [http://www.aftonbladet.se/atv/player.html?catID=2672&clipID=14502](http://www.aftonbladet.se/atv/player.html?catID=2672&clipID=14502)

Markolio at his best. Heckling the schlager-genre. The most embarrassing about this is that this song would probably have rocked at the competition. I mean that kind of music is not really innovative and challenging...

In short - I don't like schlager (or whatever the word is in english) but this song rocks.
