As [I wrote earlier](http://www.marcusoft.net/2009/03/sprint-planner-helper-session-15.html), I have been away from Stockholm for a few days. Me, Abbe, and my father-in-law went on a mini-vacation at [Hyppeln](http://www.hitta.se/LargeMap.aspx?var=Hyppeln) in the Gothenburg archipelago.

The weather was wonderful, and we had some really nice days with a hint of summer-feeling...
