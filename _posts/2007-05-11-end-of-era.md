[The GÃ¶teborg Brass band is no
more](http://www.goteborgbrassband.org.se/)... This is not news for the
band and many of the fans, including me, but it feels weird and very
sad.

I must say that I fully understand the reasoning behind the decision and
that it's probably the right thing to do - but still it so sad...

For me personally the band has been something of my idols (and almost
legends) for a long, long time. Then, in 2005, I got to play with the
band myself. I still remember the day in the office - doing cartwheels
and scream (like many other days, I hear some people say :)). That also
was the start of 2 fantastic years with the band. Very very hectic with
many travel hours to rehearsals and lots of time away on tours.

I wouldn't change a thing!
It was so great, so many memories surface; just to walk in on stage with
such a great band and great friends, to take part of the immense
knowledge during rehearsals, feeling support. For me the highlight was
to take up the solo euphonium chair for a semester (spring 2006). Every
rehearsal was a thrill.

So to all the people in the band: THANK YOU for some lovely memories and
great times. It will take a very long time (if ever) to follow the GBB
act. You (we?) are the greatest band in Sweden.
