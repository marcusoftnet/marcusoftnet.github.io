When converting from C# to VB.Net (not <span>="blsp-spelling-corrected">liking</span> it though) i often find
myself wondering "what is that keyword in VB.Net". There are tons of
pages that <span>="blsp-spelling-corrected">answer</span> that question, this one is
quite good and it can be nice to have one stop for all your questions:

<http://www.codeproject.com/dotnet/vbnet_c__difference.asp>

If it fails for any <span>="blsp-spelling-corrected">reason</span> try "\[keyword in C#\]
vb.net" in <span>="blsp-spelling-corrected">Google</span>.com. First hit will tell
you the <span>="blsp-spelling-corrected">answer</span>, never fails.
