When converting from C# to VB.Net (not liking it though) I often find
myself wondering "what is that keyword in VB.Net". There are tons of
pages that answer that question, this one is
quite good and it can be nice to have one stop for all your questions:

If it fails for any reason try "\[keyword in C#\]
vb.net" in Google.com. First hit will tell
you the answer, never fails.
