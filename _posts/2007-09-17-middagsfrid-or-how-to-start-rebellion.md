Oh my God- this (<http://www.middagsfrid.se/>) is a thing that is tempting me right now. The concept is as follows: each week a bag of groceries are delivered to your home. It contains raw material and recipes enough for you to keep you and your family going for the week, dinner-wise.

So in short - no more going to the store and not being able to find out what to do for dinner. You'll get surprised with new recipes each week.

But, I can only imaging the kind of uproar this will cause among our parents. And also - here dies the last hope of keeping home-cooking as an art...

We'll probably try it anyway...
