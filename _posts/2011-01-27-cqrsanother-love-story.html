<p>People who know me also know that I easily get all ga-ga, fall in love in or simply get very excited over thing that I like. Actually the other day I thought for myself that I right now talk a lot about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_Driven_Development" target="_blank">BDD</a>, <a href="http://www.specflow.org" target="_blank">Specflow</a> and Kanban – simply because I think that these things are just great. A quote that I often use by Dan North;</p> <blockquote> <p>“It’s no silver bullet, but this darn close”</p></blockquote> <p>When I thought about that I also came to think that I don’t want to talk about or focus on things that I don’t feel like that for. There are simply to many new concepts, frameworks and technologies out there – I cannot take them all in and of course not be ga-ga over all of them. </p> <p>The second that thought left my mind I started to watch a recording of Greg Young from <a href="http://www.oredev.org">ÖreDev</a> last year. It was called <a href="http://vimeo.com/13852695">“Unleash your domain”</a> and was about CQRS. After a short while – I was in love again. I had another of those before and after moments. I already knew about this but this time it really got to me. And stuck!</p><a name='more'></a> <p>Before I stepped on the tube I saw things one way – and after I was a completely different thing. I see my earlier work with new eyes now – I cannot believe that I wanted to do it that way. Just like when I first learned about Scrum and agile methods – how could I possibly think that what I did before was a good way to work?</p> <p>OK – I a still a newbie to the concepts but I think that the benefits from the CQRS principles are plain and clear.</p> <ul> <li>Why should we have one and the same model to do all aspects of our application? We have to make trade-offs and compromises. Simply by splitting up the read model from the write model we get a much simpler management of that  <li>Why are we often missing verbs in our domain models? The application workflow are more often than not in client or rather in the head of the user.  <li>Why are we storing state that we don’t know how it came to be? For example; if somebody Create a shopping cart, Add 3 items, Remove 1 item and Checkout we only store a shopping cart with 2 items. The fat that one item was removed in the process is discarded. That could be valuable</li></ul> <p>In the ÖreDev presentation Greg Young hinted a site call <a href="http://CQRSInfo.com">CQRSInfo.com</a>. I went there yesterday... and MY GOD! What a site. Loads of <a href="http://cqrsinfo.com/documents/">documents</a>, <a href="http://cqrsinfo.com/examples/">example</a> implementations (including <a href="http://cqrsinfo.com/2010/10/29/sculptor-simplecqrs-port/">one in Sculptor</a> by some former colleagues of mine) and this 6 hour + presentation:</p> <blockquote><object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" width="437" height="288" id="viddler"><param name="movie" value="http://www.viddler.com/player/dc528842/" /><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="flashvars" value="fake=1" /><embed src="http://www.viddler.com/player/dc528842/" width="437" height="288" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowScriptAccess="always" allowFullScreen="true" flashvars="fake=1" name="viddler"></embed></object></blockquote> <p>I will sure hang out there a lot. Thanks for some truly great content. </p> <p>I now have another thing that I’m ga-ga over. And they all play nicely together;</p> <ul> <li>Kanban to get control over my work and process</li> <li>BDD to get the collaboration with stakeholders, behavior specifications and testing&nbsp; and outside-in development in place in a nice way. </li> <li>And CQRS to create the application in a well designed manner</li></ul> <p>One of these days I need to write something on how I use them together.</p>
