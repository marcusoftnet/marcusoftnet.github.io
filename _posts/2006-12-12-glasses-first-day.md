Got my new glasses yesterday... I am not sure that I have got used to them yet. A certain dizziness and some picking-up-stuff-problems has occurred. But the will probably go away after a while.

Glasses are not cheap! What (!) are they made of when they cost that much? Must be gold or titanium something.

Well I like them so far, I can read stuff with my right eye again. Also I think I will get used to my new look.
