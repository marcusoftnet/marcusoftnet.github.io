my new glasses yesterday... I am not sure that i have got used to them
yet. A certain dizziness and some picking-up-stuff-problems has
occurred. But the will probably go away after a while.

Glasses are not cheap! What (!) are they made of when they cost that
much? Must be gold or titanium something.

Well i like them so far, i can read stuff with my right eye again. Also
i think i will get used to my new look.
