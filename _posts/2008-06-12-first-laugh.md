Yesterday we heard the first chuckle and laughter from Albert... It was
a very special feeling - for the first time you could sense his voice,
how he will sound when he talks. Also it was very moving to see him so
happy. He couldn't keep it in...

What made him laugh so, you might wonder? I told him to cough and tried
to show him how. Apparently that was hilarious and he couldn't stop to
laugh.

I'll try to catch it on picture the next time and upload it here. You'll
have to do with this picture in the mean time.
