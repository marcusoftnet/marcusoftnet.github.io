<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">

We are closing in on the end of the project (the development phase) and
it a mixture of feelings that comes over me.

First and foremost i would say it's a bit of sadness. This is the best
project i've been in so far - a lot of fun, speed, wild discussions and
great flow in the group. Much to this i have to credit SCRUM for - which
promotes just those things; building teams and delivering software.

Then of course i am proud of what we have accomplished. 100 000 lines of
code in 4 months, 4 people. And the structure of the system feels very
nice too - the bugs that are found now is quite easy to fix.

So the project is, in all right, slowing down while we are transiting
into the testing phase. Oh how i would have loved to have testers in our
team. Just imagine then we would have been beyond that phase now to...

On a personal note all other things are not slowing down; entering a
period now with very much on the agenda. Here's a short list:

-   Wedding in the weekend - Elins best friend is getting married. I am
    playing (completely alone) while they are entering and leaving.
-   Tour with Vasa band - my band are going on a tour 8-11/11. To Bognor
    Regis in the south of England. That will be great fun.
-   Christmas concert with Vasa band - i am in charge of planning and
    setting that event up. Together with the Vasa Gospel choir and that
    is always fun
-   CD with Vasa band - we are planning of recording a CD to the spring.
    I will be soloist on one track.
-   New projects, more presentations etc. at work.

Well - that should keep me busy during the autumn.
