I am preparing a talk on [SOA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture). That always scares me since it’s such a big topic. Who among us would want to answer the question, ["What is SOA?"](http://www.whatissoa.com/)

OK – in my preparations I found some great resources:

- My new house-god, [Dan North](http://dannorth.net/), has made [this fun and easy-to-follow introduction](http://dannorth.net/classic-soa).
- A lot of different stuff on [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org/) is a good starter. Here are some articles on [SOA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture), [Enterprise service bus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_service_bus), and [SOA Governance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOA_Governance) that I found useful as an introduction.
- Here is a really good discussion on why a [common domain model is no good idea](http://devlicio.us/blogs/casey/archive/2009/05/14/commercial-suicide-integration-at-the-database-level.aspx).
