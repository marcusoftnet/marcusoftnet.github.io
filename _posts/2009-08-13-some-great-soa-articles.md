I am preparing a talk on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture"
target="_blank">SOA</a>. That always scares me since it’s such a big
topic. Who among us would want to answer the question
<a href="http://www.whatissoa.com/" target="_blank">“What is SOA?”</a>

OK – in my preparations I found some great resources.

    <a href="http://dannorth.net/" target="_blank">Dan North</a> has
    made
    <a href="http://dannorth.net/classic-soa" target="_blank">this fun and
    easy to follow introduction.</a>
-   A lot of different stuff on
    <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> is
    a good starter. Here are some articles on
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture"
    target="_blank">SOA</a>,
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_service_bus"
    target="_blank">Enterprise service bus</a> and
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOA_Governance"
    target="_blank">SOA Governance</a> that I found useful as
    introduction.
-   Here is a really good discussion on why a <a
    href="http://devlicio.us/blogs/casey/archive/2009/05/14/commercial-suicide-integration-at-the-database-level.aspx"
    target="_blank">common domain model is no good idea</a>.
