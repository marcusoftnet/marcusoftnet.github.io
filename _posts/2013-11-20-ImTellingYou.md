As most of you probably know [I'm on my way to leave the country and do
other type of work for a
while](http://www.marcusoft.net/2013/06/moving-to-indonesia.html). It's
been a bumpy ride and we're actually still waiting for the work permits
before we can leave. Any day now...

The last couple of weeks I've ended most of my commitments and different
consultant contracts with my customers, but I don't have anything else
to do... so I thought I'll make something up. Two things popped into my
head:

- last year when I did some [free presentations during a
    period](http://www.marcusoft.net/2012/12/have-presentations-will-travel.html)
    between employments
- and the fact that I don't want to come back in 3 years and just
    continue with the same material

People who read this blog knows that [I love
constraints](http://www.marcusoft.net/2013/01/on-constraints.html), and
people that know me knows that I'm a Seinfeld buff. He imposed a
constraint on himself after 10-15 years in the business. He retired all
of his jokes and went on a tour called ["I'm telling you for the last
time"](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0500140/). After that he started over
with a blank sheet and never told those jokes again.






No comparison between mr Seinfeld and me but I he inspired me to try the
same. So I'm giving the presentations one last time and then retire them
forever. I will never reuse the slides, I will present the materials in
new ways. I promise!






You can join me for one or more of the presentations 25 - 29 november
2013. And as apposed from Seinfeld it's free. We'll also record it and
you can catch it later. I will update the post with links later.






<a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=36533086"
id="more"></a>When you try to do something like this it's awesome to
have a company like [Aptitud](http://www.aptitud.se/) to back you up.
The first time I posed the suggestion of doing something like this, us
giving these presentations for free for example; their immediate
reaction was just "YES! Awesome! Go for it!" Karma - that's what we run
Aptitud on.






The idea is that we run a one hour lecture during lunch, just like the
ordinary [Aptitud lunches](http://aptitud.eventbrite.com/). It's doesn't
cost you anything (as always) but you might pick some stuff up.






Here is the program for the week in question.

Specification by example is the missing step for most development teams.
It will help you to communicate better with your business stakeholders
making sure that you build the right thing.<br />
As a interesting and rewarding side effect you can get regression tests
for free. Oh yeah - and a documentation that is always up-to-date.

I've shortened some of the presentations up quite a bit (from 3-4 hours
to 1 hour in some cases) so be prepared for speed...

Pick one, or come to all. Our office is quite small so please use the
links above to register for the events. so we know how much food we need
to bring. Anders has promised to add canned laughter if any of the
presentations draw zero people in the audience. So I hope for that
too... :)

This is the last time you'll hear these presentation from me.
