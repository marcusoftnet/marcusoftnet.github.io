That's a saying I've heard in a number of place. I have a terrible
memory. Ah, it's great and everything, but it's sadly short. So I don't
lie. ~~I'm to stupid~~ I have to short memory for that.

That's such a relief! I know that going in. In everything I do. I don't
lie. I play it open. There - now you know too.

In fact, I would go so far as to say that it makes me better. Because
since I'm playing it open it puts the pressure on me to be great and
make sure that my work can take to be scrutinised and reviewed by
everyone that I share it with.
It's not scary - because that is how it is from the start.

This is the same kind of thinking that can be found behind the <a

The code is of course better, because we know that we have to take this
into consideration.

What would this be for an entire business? The "don't lie" or "Don't be
a dick" as we say
at <a href="http://aptitud.se/" target="_blank">Aptitud</a>. I was
playing this thought:

> We are running our business so that we are never nervous for audits,
> review or if a news paper/tv-station etc. tells us that they are going

We don't have to be nervous if we are already open. In fact, let's
welcome them. Let's help the find the things they need. "Embrace the
inspectors" is one of the important points of <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Turn-Ship-Around-Turning-Followers/dp/1591846404"
target="_blank">Turn the Ship around </a>. We want to be inspected,
because we want to learn. Invite them. Ask questions, ask how others
have gone about solving the problems.

But... it requires courage. And that you don't have anything to hide. Or
that you need to not have anything to hide because your memory is so
short.

I hinted in the heading that there's a certification around this
methodology. You just passed it. Reading this blog post.
