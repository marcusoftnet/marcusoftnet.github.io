## The Bungsu Story - inspirational presentation

When you have no operational permit, no customers and the very building you are operating in falls in - most organisations give up. Not so with the Salvation Army hospital in Bandung Indonesia - they decided to try to save the hospital and I was very fortunate to help them in their journey.

Me?! A lean/agile coach. A westerner with little to no knowledge in hospital management and operation.

We started to apply the principles of kanban and in doing so turned the hospital around into something amazing. Transforming not only the organisation but also some lives among the people in the staff.

While working with the hospital in this way I gained deeper insight and knowledge about what the principles of lean and kanban means and how they can be applied to make us more and more effective. And save us from disaster too...

This talk is no turned into a [book that you can get here.](http://bit.ly/bungsubook)

### Outcomes

- Inspriration through a story about hardship, preseverance, friendship, love and victory
- Knowing the foundational prinicples of kanban and how they can help in any kind of process and situation
- Some practical knowledge on how to set and and work with kanban boards

### Audience

This can be enjoyed by anyone in your organisation. It is a great way to introduce agile and lean, on a concept level to other parts of the organisation, than you normally talk agile in.

### Length

This is a 30 min to 1 hour presentation. Often I have a Q&A afterward around the coffee-tables.

## Kanban in Action - a kanban introduction

In my consultancy, I’ve come to realize that most clients/teams I’ve coach don’t care too much about the theory. This presentation, therefore, takes a standpoint in the practical parts. I will also mimic my experience with most teams I’ve introduced kanban too, and do the introduction in small iterations.This means that the presentation also is a template for anyone that will need to introduce kanban to others.

This is one hour presentation that suits any audience from 2 to 300. It is fun and engaging but ties strongly back to the foundational principles of kanban.

### Outcomes

- Overview of how kanban can help you improve your process to more effectively deliver value
- Knowing the foundational prinicples of kanban and how they can help
- Practical knowledge in how to build and manage boards for teams
- Inspiration to go on and start your improvement journey - from now until better than you ever imagined!

### Audience

This presentation is useful for almost anyone but most examples that we are using stems from system developement and maintenance. It can easily be tweaked into something that suits your particular needs and situation.

### Length

This is best as a 1 hour presentation - longer than that it is better run as a workshop (see below)

## Kanban in Action - improve my kanban board

Through my consultancy I've met many companies in different fields of work (from internet startup, through big banks and even hospitals in Indonesia). In each of these settings I have seen some similarities and common challenges.

I have therefor collected a long list (36 and growing) of practices that I keep coming back to in my recommendations and while helping teams and organisations.

This session is very practical but ties back to the theories behind kanban, lean and agile as the need arises. Most of the tips focuses on one team / one board, some of the practices have implications and benefits for the larger organsiation.

The session can be run in several different modes:

- As a pure presentation where I pick my own favorites (most borning)
- As an interactive big room presentation where audience votes for the items they like the most (require access to www.heroku.comm, interactive and interest driven)
- As a master class where I coach one team around their board and other people listen in / watches us go through some of the items on the list that the team likes the best. (great for that one team and might be the things that the others doesn't really want to see)

### Outcomes

- A lot of practical tips on how to make the board and the practices around it ever better
- Ideas and inspiration by learning from examples on how we could do our work differently
- A wide range of problem, situation and solutions to common challenges for the kanban team
- Through the example a solid understanding of what the principles of kanban, lean and agile means in practices.


### Audience

This presentation is intended for teams that already are using agile methods and wants some inspiration to take it to the next level. Since the content is audience driven we can adjust it to the level that benefits the team the most.

### Length

1 to 3 hours - depending on the audience input.

## Kanban in Action - process improvements now! And forever!

This workshop will teach you the foundations of kanban in a very practical and entertaining way. Kanban can help you improve your process to more effectively deliver value - no matter what process you are working with now, or how good you are in doing it.

Kanban is just a few basic principles and practices - but the implications of them is hugely powerful, and can change not only your team but in the long run help and improve the entire organisation around you. You will learn how to discover, little by little, how to improve your ways of working to something better than you could imagine, through the evolutionary approach to process improvements.

Kanban is "just" our guide - not a framework that tells you details on how and what. For this reason much of the content of the workshop will be driven by your needs, questions and context. This is better than me giving you a rigid framework that most likely will not suit your praticular need.

Come with an open mind and any kind of process - leave with practical tips, know-how and ideas that will help you improve. Tomorrow, and forever!

### Outcomes

- Overview of how kanban can help you improve your process to more effectively deliver value
- Knowing the foundational prinicples of kanban and how they can help
- Practical knowledge in how to build and manage boards for teams
- Practical knowledge in how to handle up/downstream processes such as ideas etc. And how to organise that
- Inspiration to go on and start your improvement journey - from now until better than you ever imagined!

### Audience

This workshop is a great kick-off for your team that is just starting using agile methods or can also be used to reboot your work after reoorgs, new projects etc. It is fun, inclusive and interactive.

### Length

At least 3 hours, I have done it full days as well

## Kanban in Action - upstream work

This workshop focuses on some of the practices that happens before work hits a development team. Often these parts are left out to some poor product owner to just figure out and keep track of. But in true lean spirit we should consider the entire workflow from idea to production, from a customer perspective.

I have gather a few of the practices that I've come to appreciate and got great value from during my agile consultancy since 2005. I draw experiences from many different clients in many different fields - ranging from startups, via banks all the way to hospitals in Indonesia.

### Outcomes

- Overview of how kanban can help you improve your process to more effectively deliver value
- Knowing the foundational prinicples of kanban and how they can help
- Practical knowledge in how to build and manage boards for teams
- Practical knowledge in how to handle up/downstream processes such as ideas etc. And how to organise that

### Audience

This workshop is useful to connect the product team (product owner etc) closer to a development team, or for a product team by themselves.

### Length

1 to 3 hours
